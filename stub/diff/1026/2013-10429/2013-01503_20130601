When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor, \u00a7 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) permits the creditor to give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See also comment 17(c)(6)-2. Section 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) addresses only how a creditor may elect to disclose a construction-permanent transaction. Which disclosure option a creditor elects under \u00a7 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) does not affect the determination of whether the permanent phase of the transaction is subject to \u00a7 1026.35. When the creditor discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine whether the transaction is a higher-priced mortgage loan under \u00a7 1026.35(a). When the creditor discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with \u00a7 1026.22(a)(1) and appendix D to part 1026. This annual percentage rate must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine the transaction is a higher-priced mortgage loan under \u00a7 1026.35(a). If the transaction is determined to be a higher-priced mortgage loan, only the permanent phase is subject to the requirement of \u00a7 1026.35(b)(1) to establish and maintain an escrow account, and the period for which the escrow account must remain in place under \u00a7 1026.35(b)(3) is measured from the time the conversion to the permanent phase financing occurs.",

Escrow accounts established for first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans on or after April 1, 2010, and before June 1, 2013, are not counted for purposes of \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D). On and after June 1, 2013, creditors, together with their affiliates, that establish new escrow accounts, other than those described in \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(2), do not qualify for the exemption provided under \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii). Creditors, together with their affiliates, that continue to maintain escrow accounts established between April 1, 2010, and June 1, 2013, still qualify for the exemption provided under \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) so long as they do not establish new escrow accounts for transactions consummated on or after June 1, 2013, other than those described in \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(2), and they otherwise qualify under \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iii).",
