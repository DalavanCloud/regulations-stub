Section 1026.43(a)(3)(vii) excludes certain transactions from the credit extension limit set forth in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(1), provided a transaction meets several conditions. The terms of the credit contract must satisfy the conditions that the transaction not require the payment of interest under \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(vii)(C) and that repayment of the amount of credit extended be forgiven or deferred in accordance with \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(vii)(D). The other requirements of \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(vii) need not be reflected in the credit contract, but the creditor must retain evidence of compliance with those provisions, as required by \u00a7 1026.25(a). In particular, the creditor must have information reflecting that the total of closing costs imposed in connection with the transaction is less than 1 percent of the amount of credit extended and include no charges other than recordation, application, and housing counseling fees, in accordance with \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(vii)(E). Unless an itemization of the amount financed sufficiently details this requirement, the creditor must establish compliance with \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(vii)(E) by some other written document and retain it in accordance with \u00a7 1026.25(a).",
