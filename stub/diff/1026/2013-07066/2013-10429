            "text":"Independent ability-to-pay standard.Under \u00a7 1026.51(b)(2), if a credit card account has been opened pursuant to \u00a7 1026.51(b)(1)(i), no increase in the credit limit may be made on such account before the consumer attains the age of 21 unless, at the time of the contemplated increase, the consumer has an independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments on the increased limit, consistent with \u00a7 1026.51(b)(1)(i), or a cosigner, guarantor, or joint applicant who is at least 21 years old assumes liability for any debt incurred on the account, consistent with \u00a7 1026.51(b)(1)(ii). Thus, when a card issuer is considering whether to increase the credit limit on an existing account, \u00a7 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(A) requires that consumers who have not attained the age of 21 and do not have a cosigner, guarantor, or joint applicant who is 21 years or older must have an independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments as of the time of the contemplated increase. Thus, the card issuer may not consider income or assets to which an accountholder, cosigner, or guarantor, in each case who is under the age of 21 and is or will be liable for debts incurred on the account, has only a reasonable expectation of access under \u00a7 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(A). The card issuer, however, may consider income or assets to which an accountholder, cosigner, or guarantor, in each case who is age 21 or older and is or will be liable for debts incurred on the account, has a reasonable expectation of access under \u00a7 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(B). Information regarding income and assets that satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 1026.51(b)(1)(i) also satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(A) and card issuers may rely on the guidance in the commentary to \u00a7 1026.51(b)(1)(i) for purposes of determining whether an accountholder who is less than 21 years old has the independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments in accordance with \u00a7 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(A). Information regarding income and assets that satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 1026.51(a) also satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(B) and card issuers may rely on the guidance in comments 51(a)(1)-4, -5, and -6 for purposes of determining whether a cosigner, guarantor, or joint applicant who is at least 21 years old has the ability to make the required minimum periodic payments in accordance with \u00a7 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(B).",
