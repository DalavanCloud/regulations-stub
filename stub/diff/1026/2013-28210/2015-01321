For this purpose, \u201cpast due\u201d means the failure to make a periodic payment (in one full payment or in two or more partial payments) sufficient to cover principal, interest, and, if applicable, escrow under the terms of the legal obligation. Other amounts, such as any late fees, are not considered for this purpose. For purposes of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(3), a periodic payment is 30 days past due when it is not paid on or before the due date of the following scheduled periodic payment and is 60 days past due when, after already becoming 30 days past due, it is not paid on or before the due date of the next scheduled periodic payment. For purposes of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(3), the creditor or assignee may treat a received payment as applying to the oldest outstanding periodic payment. The following example illustrates the meaning of 60 days past due for purposes of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(3):",

However, \u00a7 1026.43(e)(3)(iv) provides that, for purposes of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(3)(iii), the creditor or assignee can pay to the consumer an amount that exceeds the sum of the amounts described in \u00a7 1026.43(e)(3)(iv)(A) and (B).

The terms of the credit contract must satisfy the conditions that the transaction not require the payment of interest under \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(vii)(C) and that repayment of the amount of credit extended be forgiven or deferred in accordance with \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(vii)(D).
