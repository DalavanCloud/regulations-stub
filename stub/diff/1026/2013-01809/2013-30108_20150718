To explain further, loans enumerated in \u00a7 1026.43(a) are not \u201ccovered transaction\u201d under the Bureau\u2019s ability-to-repay requirements in \u00a7 1026.43, and thus cannot be qualified mortgages (entitled to a rebuttable presumption or safe harbor of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements of \u00a7 1026.43, see, e.g., \u00a7 1026.43(e)(1)). These include an extension of credit made pursuant to a program administered by a Housing Finance Agency, as defined under 24 CFR 266.5, or pursuant to a program authorized by sections 101 and 109 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. See \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(iv) and (vi). They also include extensions of credit made by a creditor identified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v).

For example, assume that HUD has prescribed rules to define loans insured under its programs that are qualified mortgages and those rules are in effect. Assume further that a creditor designated as a Community Development Financial Institution, as defined under 12 CFR 1805.104(h), originates a loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which is a part of HUD. The loan is not a \u201ccovered transaction\u201d and thus is not a qualified mortgage. See \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(A) and (b)(1). Nonetheless, the transaction is eligible for an exemption from the appraisal requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(c) if it meets the qualified mortgage criteria in HUD\u2019s rules.

For guidance on the meaning of refinancing costs, see comment 23(f)\u20134. If the proceeds of a refinancing are used for other purposes, such as to pay off other liens or to provide additional cash to the consumer for discretionary spending, the transaction does not qualify for the exemption for a refinancing under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(vii) from the appraisal requirements in \u00a7 1026.35(c).",
