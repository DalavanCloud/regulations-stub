            "text":"Recording fees.Section 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) provides that an estimate of a charge for a third-party service or recording fees is in good faith if the conditions specified in \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(A), (B), and (C) are satisfied. Recording fees are not charges for third-party services because recording fees are paid to the applicable government entity where the documents related to the mortgage transaction are recorded, and thus, the condition specified in \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(B) that the charge for third-party service not be paid to an affiliate of the creditor is inapplicable for recording fees. The condition specified in \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(C), that the creditor permits the consumer to shop for the third-party service, is similarly inapplicable. Therefore, estimates of recording fees need only satisfy the condition specified in \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(A) to meet the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii). 5. Calculating the aggregate amount of estimated charges. In calculating the aggregate amount of estimated charges for purposes of conducting the good faith analysis pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii), the aggregate amount of estimated charges must reflect charges for services that are actually performed. For example, assume that the creditor included a $100 estimated fee for a pest inspection in the disclosures provided pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), and the fee is included in the category of charges subject to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii), but a pest inspection was not obtained in connection with the transaction, then for purposes of the good faith analysis required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii), the sum of all charges subject to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) paid by or imposed on the consumer is compared to the sum of all such charges disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e), minus the $100 estimated pest inspection fee.",

For example, \u201cmonthly interest accrual amortization\u201d treats each payment as made on the scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid early or late (until the expiration of any grace period). Thus, under the terms of a loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or on May 10. In this example, if the consumer prepays the loan in full on April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a prepayment penalty of $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20 is only $2,000.",

Pursuant to \u00a7 1026.38(t)(4)(i)(C), however, any \u201cLoan Estimate\u201d amount that is disclosed in the alternative \u201cCalculating Cash to Close\u201d table under \u00a7 1026.38(e) is shown to the nearest dollar amount, and thus matches the corresponding estimated amount disclosed on the Loan Estimate\u2019s \u201cCalculating Cash to Close\u201d table under \u00a7 1026.37(h), which is shown to the nearest whole dollar pursuant to \u00a7 1026.37(o)(4)(i)(A). For this reason, a \u201cFinal\u201d amount shown to two decimal places could be a larger number than its corresponding \u201cEstimate\u201d amount shown to the nearest whole dollar, when, in fact, the apparent increase is due solely to rounding. Therefore, for purposes of \u00a7 1026.38(e)(1)(iii), (2)(iii), (3)(iii), and (4)(iii), each statement of a change between the amounts disclosed on the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure is based on the actual, nonrounded estimate that would have been disclosed on the Loan Estimate under \u00a7 1026.37(h) if it had been shown to two decimal places rather than a whole dollar amount. For example, if the \u201cLoan Estimate\u201d amount of \u201cTotal Closing Costs\u201d disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(e)(2)(i) is $12,500, and the \u201cFinal\u201d amount of \u201cTotal Closing Costs\u201d disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(e)(2)(ii) is $12,500.35, then even though the table would appear to show a $0.35 increase in \u201cTotal Closing Costs,\u201d no statement of such increase is given under \u00a7 1026.38(e)(2)(iii) so long as the actual, non-rounded estimate (i.e., the estimated amount of \u201cTotal Closing Costs\u201d that would have been shown on the Loan Estimate to two decimal places) is equal to $12,500.35.",

These statements are more prominent than the other disclosures under \u00a7 1026.38(e). The statement of whether the estimated and final amounts are different, stated as a \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d in capital letters and in boldface, under the subheading \u201cDid this change?,\u201d as shown on forms H\u2013 25(E) and H\u201325(G) of appendix H to this part, complies with the requirement to state whether the amounts are different more prominently. Such statement of \u201cNo\u201d satisfies the requirement to state that the estimated and final amounts are equal, and these sections do not provide for any narrative text to be included with such statement. The prominence requirement also requires that, in the event an increase or decrease in costs has occurred, certain words within the narrative text to be included under the subheading \u201cDid this change?\u201d for a \u201cYes\u201d answer are displayed more prominently than other disclosures. For example, under \u00a7 1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A), this more prominent statement could take the form of the phrases \u201cTotal Loan Costs (D)\u201d and \u201cTotal Other Costs (I)\u201d being shown in boldface, as shown on forms H\u201325(E) and H\u201325(G) of appendix H to this part.

In many cases, the creditor cannot determine, at the time the disclosure is made, whether a loan may be assumable at a future date on its original terms. For example, the assumption clause commonly used in mortgages sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation conditions an assumption on a variety of factors, such as the creditworthiness of the subsequent borrower, the potential for impairment of the creditor\u2019s security, and the execution of an assumption agreement by the subsequent borrower. If the creditor can determine that such assumption is not permitted, the creditor complies with \u00a7 1026.37(m)(2) by disclosing that the loan is not assumable. In all other situations, including where assumption of a loan is permitted or is dependent on certain conditions or factors, or uncertainty exists as to the future assumability of a mortgage loan, the creditor complies with \u00a7 1026.37(m)(2) by disclosing that, under certain conditions, the creditor may allow a third party to assume the loan on its original terms.",

For the first five years of the loan term, the scheduled payments cover only interest and the loan has an introductory interest rate that is fixed at 4.00 percent. After five years, the payments include principal and the interest rate adjusts every three years based on the value of the Monthly Treasury Average index plus a margin of 4.00 percent.

The period of seasonal payments required to be disclosed by \u00a7 1026.37(i)(4), to be clear and conspicuous, should be disclosed with a noun that identifies the unit-period, because such feature may apply on a regular basis during the loan term that does not depend on when regular periodic payments begin.

For example, assume that at consummation the consumer must pay four itemized charges that are subject to the good faith determination under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i). If the actual amounts paid by the consumer for the four itemized charges subject to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i) exceeded their respective estimates on the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) by $30, $25, $25, and $10, then there would be a $90 excess amount above the limitations prescribed by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i). If, further, the amounts paid by the consumer for services that are subject to the good faith determination under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) totaled $1,190, but the respective estimates on the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) totaled only $1,000, then there would be a $90 excess amount above the limitations prescribed by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(ii).

For an example of such disclosure, see form H\u201324 of appendix H to this part. The disclosure under \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4) applies to transactions where the terms of the loan contract provide for a prepayment penalty, even though the creditor does not know at the time of the disclosure whether the consumer will, in fact, make a payment to the creditor that would cause imposition of the penalty. For example, if the monthly interest accrual amortization method described in comment 37(b)(4)\u20132.i is used such that interest is assessed on the balance for a full month even if the consumer makes a full prepayment before the end of the month, the transaction includes a prepayment penalty that must be disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4).",

Finance charges that do not take into account each reduction in the principal balance of an obligation may include precomputed finance charges. If any portion of an unearned precomputed finance charge will not be provided as a rebate upon full prepayment, the disclosure required by \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4) will be an affirmative answer, indicate the maximum amount of such precomputed finance charge that may not be provided as a rebate to the consumer upon any prepayment, and state when the period during which a full rebate would not be provided terminates, as required by \u00a7 1026.37(b)(7). If, instead, there will be a full rebate of the precomputed finance charge and no other prepayment penalty imposed on the consumer, to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4) and (7), the creditor states a negative answer only. If the transaction involves both a precomputed finance charge and a finance charge computed by application of a rate to an unpaid balance, disclosure about both the entitlement to any rebate of the finance charge upon prepayment and any other prepayment penalty are made as one disclosure under \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4), stating one affirmative or negative answer and an aggregated amount and time period for the information required by \u00a7 1026.37(b)(7). For example, if in such a transaction, a portion of the precomputed finance charge will not be provided as a rebate and the loan contract also provides for a prepayment penalty based on the amount prepaid, both disclosures are made under \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4) as one aggregate amount, stating the maximum amount and time period under \u00a7 1026.37(b)(7). If the transaction instead provides a rebate of the precomputed finance charge upon prepayment, but imposes a prepayment penalty based on the amount prepaid, to comply with \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4), the creditor states an affirmative answer and the information about the prepayment penalty, as required by \u00a7 1026.37(b)(7).

See comments 17(c)(1)\u2013 1, 17(c)(2)(i)\u20131 and \u20132, and 19(e)(1)(i)\u20131.

The portion of the form pertaining to the inapplicable disclosure may be left blank, unless otherwise provided by \u00a7 1026.37. For example, in a transaction for which the consumer does not pay points to the creditor to reduce the interest rate, the amounts required to be disclosed by \u00a7 1026.37(f)(1)(i) may be left blank on form H\u201324. As provided in \u00a7 1026.37(i) and (j), however, the adjustable payment and adjustable interest rate tables required by those paragraphs may be included only if those disclosures are applicable to the transaction and otherwise must be excluded.",

The estimate was based on information provided by the consumer at application, which included information indicating that the subject property was a single-family dwelling. Upon arrival at the subject property, the appraiser discovers that the property is actually a single-family dwelling located on a farm. A different schedule of appraisal fees applies to residences located on farms. A changed circumstance has occurred (i.e., information provided by the consumer is found to be inaccurate after the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) were provided), which caused an increase in the cost of the appraisal. Therefore, if the creditor issues revised disclosures with the corrected appraisal fee, the actual appraisal fee of $400 paid at the real estate closing by the consumer will be compared to the revised appraisal fee of $400 to determine if the actual fee has increased above the estimated fee. However, if the creditor failed to provide revised disclosures, then the actual appraisal fee of $400 must be compared to the originally disclosed estimated appraisal fee of $200.",

For example, assume a loan with a 30-year term with a payment that adjusts every month for the first 12 months and is fixed thereafter, where mortgage insurance is not required, and where no escrow account would be established for the payment of charges described in \u00a7 1026.37(c)(4)(ii). The creditor discloses as a single range of payments the initial periodic payment and the periodic payment that would apply after each payment adjustment during the first 12 months and would also disclose, as an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments, the periodic principal and interest payment or range of payments that would apply after the payment becomes fixed. Assume instead a loan with a 30- year term with a payment that adjusts upward at three months and at six months and is fixed thereafter, where mortgage insurance is not required, and where no escrow account would be established for the payment of charges described in \u00a7 1026.37(c)(4)(ii). The creditor discloses as a single range of payments the initial periodic payment, the periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that occurs at three months, and the periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that occurs at six months, which single range represents the minimum payment and maximum payment, respectively, which would apply during the first year of the loan. Pursuant to \u00a7 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D), the creditor also discloses as an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments, the principal and interest payment that would apply on the oneyear anniversary of the due date of the initial periodic payment or range of payments, because that is the anniversary that immediately follows the occurrence of the multiple payments or ranges of payments that occurred during the first year of the loan. Assume that the same loan has a payment that, instead of becoming fixed after the adjustment at six months, adjusts once more at 18 months and becomes fixed thereafter. The creditor would disclose the same single range of payments for year one. Pursuant to \u00a7 1026.37(c)(1)(iii)(B), the creditor also discloses the principal and interest payment that would apply on the oneyear anniversary of the due date of the initial periodic payment (as required by \u00a7 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D)) and the periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that occurs at 18 months as a single range of payments in year two. Pursuant to \u00a7 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D), the creditor also discloses as an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments, the principal and interest payment that would apply on the two-year anniversary of the due date of the initial periodic payment or range of payments, because that is the anniversary that immediately follows the occurrence of the multiple payments or ranges of payments that occurred during the second year of the loan.",

The documentation must support the components and methods of calculation. For example, if a creditor calculates an average charge for a particular county recording fee by simply averaging all of the relevant fees paid in the prior month, the creditor need only retain the receipts for the individual recording fees, a ledger demonstrating that the total amount received did not exceed the total amount paid over time, and a document detailing the calculation. However, if a creditor develops complex algorithms for determining averages, not only must the creditor maintain the underlying receipts and ledgers, but the creditor must maintain documentation sufficiently detailed to allow an examiner to verify the accuracy of the calculations.",

The provisions of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2) apply prior to a consumer\u2019s receipt of the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), and therefore, restrict activity that may occur prior to receipt of an application by a creditor or mortgage broker under \u00a7 1026.19(e). These provisions include \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2)(i), which restricts the fees that may be imposed on a consumer, \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2)(ii), which requires a statement to be included on written estimates of terms or costs specific to a consumer, and \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2)(iii), which prohibits creditors from requiring the submission of documents verifying information related to the consumer\u2019s application. Accordingly, the provisions under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2) are effective on August 1, 2015, without respect to whether an application has been received on that date. In addition, the amendments to \u00a7 1026.28 and the commentary to \u00a7 1026.29 govern the preemption of State laws and thus, the amendments to those provisions and associated commentary made by the TILA\u2013RESPA Final Rule are effective on August 1, 2015, without respect to whether an application has been received on that date.

However, the creditor may not utilize an estimate without exercising due diligence to obtain the actual term for the consumer\u2019s transaction. See comment 19(f)(1)(i)\u20132.i. The creditor is required to provide corrected disclosures containing the actual terms of the transaction at or before consummation under \u00a7 1026.19(f)(2), subject to the exceptions provided for in that paragraph. Disclosures under \u00a7 1026.19(f) are subject to the labeling rules set forth in \u00a7 1026.38. See comment 17(c)(2)(i)\u20132 for guidance on labeling estimates. iii. Settlement agent. If a settlement agent provides disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(i) three business days before consummation pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(v), the \u201cbest information reasonably available\u201d standard applies to terms for which the actual term is unknown to the settlement agent at the time the disclosures are provided. The settlement agent normally may rely on the representations of other parties in obtaining information, but if information about actual terms is not reasonably available, the settlement agent also must satisfy the \u201cbest information reasonably available\u201d standard. Accordingly, the settlement agent is required to exercise due diligence to obtain information if it is providing the Closing Disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(v). For example, for the loan terms table required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(b), the settlement agent would be considered to have exercised due diligence if it obtained such information from the creditor. Because the creditor remains responsible under \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(v) for ensuring that the Closing Disclosure is provided in accordance with \u00a7 1026.19(f), the creditor is expected to maintain communication with the settlement agent to ensure that the settlement agent is acting in place of the creditor.

            "text":"Electronic delivery.The three-business-day period provided in \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(iv) applies to methods of electronic delivery, such as email. For example, if a creditor sends the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e) via email on Monday, pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(iv) the consumer is considered to have received the disclosures on Thursday, three business days later. The creditor may, alternatively, rely on evidence that the consumer received the emailed disclosures earlier. For example, if the creditor emails the disclosures at 1 p.m. on Tuesday, the consumer emails the creditor with an acknowledgement of receipt of the disclosures at 5 p.m. on the same day, the creditor could demonstrate that the disclosures were received on the same day. Creditors using electronic delivery methods, such as email, must also comply with \u00a7 1026.37(o)(3)(iii), which provides that the disclosures in \u00a7 1026.37 may be provided to the consumer in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. For example, if a creditor delivers the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) to a consumer via email, but the creditor did not obtain the consumer\u2019s consent to receive disclosures via email prior to delivering the disclosures, then the creditor does not comply with \u00a7 1026.37(o)(3)(iii), and the creditor does not comply with \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), assuming the disclosures were not provided in a different manner in accordance with the timing requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(iii).",

If, however, there are less than four business days between the time the revised version of the disclosures is required to be provided pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(4)(i) and consummation, creditors comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(4) if the revised disclosures are reflected in the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(i).

The creditor must determine the maximum of each amount used in calculating the prepayment penalty. For example, if a transaction is fully amortizing and the prepayment penalty is two percent of the loan balance at the time of prepayment, the prepayment penalty amount should be determined by using the highest loan balance possible during the period in which the penalty may be imposed.

Non-specific lender credits are generalized payments from the creditor to the consumer that do not pay for a particular fee on the disclosures provided pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1). Specific lender credits are specific payments, such as a credit, rebate, or reimbursement, from a creditor to the consumer to pay for a specific fee. Nonspecific lender credits and specific lender credits are negative charges to the consumer. The actual total amount of lender credits, whether specific or non-specific, provided by the creditor that is less than the estimated \u201clender credits\u201d identified in \u00a7 1026.37(g)(6)(ii) and disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e) is an increased charge to the consumer for purposes of determining good faith under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i). For example, if the creditor discloses a $750 estimate for \u201clender credits\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e), but only $500 of lender credits is actually provided to the consumer, the creditor has not complied with \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i) because the actual amount of lender credits provided is less than the estimated \u201clender credits\u201d disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e), and is therefore, an increased charge to the consumer for purposes of determining good faith under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i). However, if the creditor discloses a $750 estimate for \u201clender credits\u201d identified in \u00a7 1026.37(g)(6)(ii) to cover the cost of a $750 appraisal fee, and the appraisal fee subsequently increases by $150, and the creditor increases the amount of the lender credit by $150 to pay for the increase, the credit is not being revised in a way that violates the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i) because, although the credit increased from the amount disclosed, the amount paid by the consumer did not. However, if the creditor discloses a $750 estimate for \u201clender credits\u201d to cover the cost of a $750 appraisal fee, but subsequently reduces the credit by $50 because the appraisal fee decreased by $50, then the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i) have been violated because, although the amount of the appraisal fee decreased, the amount of the lender credit decreased. See also \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(D) and comment 19(e)(3)(iv)(D)\u20131 for a discussion of lender credits in the context of interest rate dependent charges.",

There are two elements to satisfying \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C). First, a nonprofit entity must service 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans, including any mortgage loans serviced on behalf of associated nonprofit entities. For each associated nonprofit entity, the small servicer determination is made separately, without consideration of the number of loans serviced by another associated nonprofit entity. Second, a nonprofit entity must service only mortgage loans for which the servicer (or an associated nonprofit entity) is the creditor. To be the creditor, the servicer (or an associated nonprofit entity) must have been the entity to which the mortgage loan obligation was initially payable (that is, the originator of the mortgage loan). A nonprofit entity is not a small servicer under \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C) if it services any mortgage loans for which the servicer (or an associated nonprofit entity) is not the creditor (that is, for which the servicer or an associated nonprofit entity was not the originator). The first of the following two examples demonstrates circumstances in which a nonprofit entity would qualify as a small servicer under \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C) because it meets both requirements for determining a nonprofit entity's status as a small servicer under \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C). The second example demonstrates circumstances in which a nonprofit entity would not qualify as a small servicer under \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C) because it does not meet both requirements under \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C).",

The consumer may have a number of options with respect to the final payment, including, among other things, retaining the property and making the final payment, refinancing the final payment, or transferring the property to the creditor in lieu of the final payment. Such transactions may have some of the characteristics of lease transactions subject to Regulation M (12 CFR part 1013), but are considered credit transactions where the consumer assumes the indicia of ownership, including the risks, burdens and benefits of ownership, upon consummation. These transactions are governed by the disclosure requirements of this part instead of Regulation M.

A creditor is not required to collect the consumer\u2019s name, monthly income, social security number to obtain a credit report, the property address, an estimate of the value of the property, or the mortgage loan amount sought. However, for purposes of determining whether an estimate is provided in good faith under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), a creditor is presumed to have collected these six pieces of information. For example, if a creditor provides the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) prior to receiving the property address from the consumer, the creditor cannot subsequently claim that the receipt of the property address is a changed circumstance pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A) or (B).",

For example, a war or a natural disaster would be an extraordinary event beyond the control of an interested party. A changed circumstance may also be an unexpected event specific to the consumer or the transaction. For example, if the creditor provided an estimate of title insurance on the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), but the title insurer goes out of business during underwriting, then this unexpected event specific to the transaction is a changed circumstance. A changed circumstance may also be information specific to the consumer or transaction that the creditor relied upon when providing the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and that was inaccurate or changed after the disclosures were provided. For example, if the creditor relied on the consumer\u2019s income when providing the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), and the consumer represented to the creditor that the consumer had an annual income of $90,000, but underwriting determines that the consumer\u2019s annual income is only $80,000, then this inaccuracy in information relied upon is a changed circumstance. Or, assume two co-applicants applied for a mortgage loan. One applicant\u2019s income was $30,000, while the other applicant\u2019s income was $50,000. If the creditor relied on the combined income of $80,000 when providing the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), but the applicant earning $30,000 becomes unemployed during underwriting, thereby reducing the combined income to $50,000, then this change in information relied upon is a changed circumstance. A changed circumstance may also be the discovery of new information specific to the consumer or transaction that the creditor did not rely on when providing the original disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i). For example, if the creditor relied upon the value of the property in providing the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), but during underwriting a neighbor of the seller, upon learning of the impending sale of the property, files a claim contesting the boundary of the property to be sold, then this new information specific to the transaction is a changed circumstance.",

For example, if the creditor requires the consumer to pay money into a reserve account for the future payment of taxes, the creditor must disclose to the consumer the exact amount that the consumer is required to pay into the reserve account.

Title to the property is conveyed to the land trust for which the financial institution itself is trustee. The underlying installment note is executed by the financial institution in its capacity as trustee and payment is secured by a trust deed, reflecting title in the financial institution as trustee. In some instances, the consumer executes a personal guaranty of the indebtedness. The note provides that it is payable only out of the property specifically described in the trust deed and that the trustee has no personal liability on the note. Assuming the transactions are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, these transactions are subject to the regulation because in substance (if not form) consumer credit is being extended.",

If during the 30-day period following consummation, an event in connection with the settlement of the transaction occurs that causes such disclosures to become inaccurate and such inaccuracy results in a change to the amount actually paid by the seller from that amount disclosed under \u00a7 1026.19(f)(4)(i), the settlement agent shall deliver or place in the mail corrected disclosures not later than 30 days after receiving information sufficient to establish that such event has occurred. Section 1026.19(f)(4)(i) requires disclosure of the items that relate to the seller\u2019s transaction. Thus, the settlement agent need only redisclose if an item related to the seller\u2019s transaction becomes inaccurate and such inaccuracy results in a change to the amount actually paid by the seller. For example, assume a transaction where the seller pays the transfer tax, the consummation occurs on Monday, and the security instrument is recorded on Tuesday, the day after consummation. If the settlement agent receives information on Tuesday sufficient to establish that transfer taxes owed to the State differ from those disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(f)(4)(i), the settlement agent complies with \u00a7 1026.19(f)(4)(ii) by revising the disclosures accordingly and delivering or placing them in the mail not later than 30 days after Tuesday. See comment 19(e)(4)(i)\u20131 for guidance on when sufficient information has been received to establish an event has occurred. See also comment 19(f)(2)(iii)\u20131.iii for another example in which corrected disclosures must be provided to the seller.",

A creditor may find that, even though it developed an averagecost pricing program in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(f)(3)(ii), over time it has collected more from consumers than it has paid to settlement service providers. For example, assume a creditor defines a class of transactions and uses that class to develop an average charge of $135 for pest inspections. The creditor then charges $135 per transaction for 100 transactions from January 1 through April 30, but the actual average cost to the creditor of pest inspections during this period is $115. The creditor then decreases the average charge for the May to August period to account for the lower average cost during the January to April period. At this point, the creditor has collected $2,000 more than it has paid to settlement service providers for pest inspections. The creditor then charges $115 per transaction for 70 transactions from May 1 to August 30, but the actual average cost to the creditor of pest inspections during this period is $125. Based on the average cost to the creditor from the May to August period, the average charge to the consumer for the September to December period should be $125. However, while the creditor spent $700 more than it collected during the May to August period, it collected $1,300 more than it spent from January to August. In cases such as these, the creditor remains responsible for ensuring that the amount collected from consumers does not exceed the total amounts paid for the corresponding settlement services over time. The creditor may develop a variety of methods that achieve this outcome. For example, the creditor may choose to refund the proportional overage paid to the affected consumers. Or the creditor may choose to factor in the excess amount collected to decrease the average charge for an upcoming period. Although any method may comply with this requirement, a creditor is deemed to have complied if it defines a six-month time period and establishes a rolling monthly period of reevaluation. For example, assume a creditor defines a six-month time period from January 1 to June 30 and the creditor uses the average charge starting July 1. If, at the end of July, the creditor recalculates the average cost from February 1 to July 31, and then uses the recalculated average cost for transactions starting August 1, the creditor complies with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(f)(3)(ii), even if the creditor actually collected more from consumers than was paid to providers over time.",

A creditor may delay the period by a reasonable amount of time if such delay is needed to perform the necessary analysis and update the affected systems, provided that each subsequent period is scheduled accordingly. For example, a creditor may define a fourmonth period from January 1 to April 30 and begin using the average charge from that period on May 15, provided the average charge is used until September 15, at which time the average charge for the period from May 1 to August 31 becomes effective.",

            "text":"If the loan has an adjustable rate under which the regular periodic payments may increase after consummation, but the amounts of such payment increases (if any) are unknown at the time of consummation, then the regular periodic payments are based on the fully-indexed rate, except as otherwise determined by any premium or discounted rates, the application of any interest rate adjustment caps, or any other known, scheduled rates under the terms specified in the loan contract. For analogous guidance, see comments 17(c)(1)\u20138 and \u201310. Similarly, if a loan has an adjustable interest rate which does not adjust the regular periodic payment but would, if the rate increased, increase only the final payment, the amount of the final payment for purposes of the balloon payment determination is based on the fully-indexed rate, except as otherwise determined by any premium or discounted rate caps, or any other known, scheduled rates under the terms specified in the loan contract. For example, assume that, under a 30-year adjustable rate mortgage, (1) the loan contract requires monthly payments of $300 during years one through five, (2) the loan contract permits interest rate increases every three years starting in the sixth year up to the fully-indexed rate, subject to caps on interest rate adjustments specified in the loan contract, (3) based on the application of the interest rate adjustment caps, the interest rate may increase to the fullyindexed rate starting in year nine, and (4) the monthly payment based on the fully-indexed rate is $700. The regular periodic payments during years one through five are $300 per month, because they are known and scheduled. The regular periodic payments during years six through eight are up to $700 per month, based on the fully-indexed rate but subject to the application of interest rate adjustment caps specified under the loan contract. The regular periodic payments during years nine through thirty are $700, based on the fully-indexed rate. Therefore, if an irregular payment of $1,000 is scheduled during the final month of year 30, that payment is disclosed as a balloon payment under \u00a7 1026.37(b)(5), because it is more than two times the regular periodic payment amount of $300 during years one through five. This is the case even though the irregular payment is not more than two times the regular periodic payment during years nine through thirty (i.e., based on the fully-indexed rate). However, the regular periodic payments during years six through thirty themselves are not balloon payments, even though they may be more than two times the regular periodic payments during years one through five.",

To explain further, loans enumerated in \u00a7 1026.43(a) are not \u201ccovered transaction\u201d under the Bureau\u2019s ability-to-repay requirements in \u00a7 1026.43, and thus cannot be qualified mortgages (entitled to a rebuttable presumption or safe harbor of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements of \u00a7 1026.43, see, e.g., \u00a7 1026.43(e)(1)). These include an extension of credit made pursuant to a program administered by a Housing Finance Agency, as defined under 24 CFR 266.5, or pursuant to a program authorized by sections 101 and 109 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. See \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(iv) and (vi). They also include extensions of credit made by a creditor identified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v). However, these loans are eligible for the exemption in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(i) if they meet the Bureau\u2019s qualified mortgage criteria in \u00a7 1026.43(e)(2), (4), (5), or (6) or \u00a7 1026.43(f) (including limits on when loans must be consummated) or, for loans that are insured, guaranteed, or administered by HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS, in applicable rules prescribed by those agencies (but only once such rules are in effect; otherwise, the Bureau\u2019s criteria for a qualified mortgage applies to those loans). For example, assume that HUD has prescribed rules to define loans insured under its programs that are qualified mortgages and those rules are in effect. Assume further that a creditor designated as a Community Development Financial Institution, as defined under 12 CFR 1805.104(h), originates a loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which is a part of HUD. The loan is not a \u201ccovered transaction\u201d and thus is not a qualified mortgage. See \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(A) and (b)(1). Nonetheless, the transaction is eligible for an exemption from the appraisal requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(c) if it meets the qualified mortgage criteria in HUD\u2019s rules. Nothing in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(i) alters the definition of a qualified mortgage under regulations of the Bureau, HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS.",

In an adjustable-rate or step-rate transaction in which more than one interest rate applies during the period from consummation until payment is made to the consumer, the minimum payment amount is determined by calculating interest on the dollar amount described in \u00a7 1026.43(e)(3)(iv)(A) at each such interest rate for the part of the overall period during which that rate applies. However, \u00a7 1026.43(e)(3)(iv) provides that, for purposes of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(3)(iii), the creditor or assignee can pay to the consumer an amount that exceeds the sum of the amounts described in \u00a7 1026.43(e)(3)(iv)(A) and (B).

Pursuant to \u00a7 1026.38(t)(4)(i)(C), however, any \u201cLoan Estimate\u201d amount that is disclosed in the \u201cCalculating Cash to Close\u201d table under \u00a7 1026.38(i) is shown rounded to the nearest dollar amount, and thus matches the corresponding estimated amount disclosed on the Loan Estimate\u2019s \u201cCalculating Cash to Close\u201d table under \u00a7 1026.37(h), which is shown rounded to the nearest whole dollar pursuant to \u00a7 1026.37(o)(4)(i)(A). For this reason, a \u201cFinal\u201d amount shown to two decimal places could be a larger number than its corresponding \u201cLoan Estimate\u201d amount shown rounded to the nearest whole dollar, when, in fact, the apparent increase is due solely to rounding.

For example, if the \u201cLoan Estimate\u201d amount of \u201cTotal Closing Costs\u201d disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(i)(1)(i) is $12,500, and the \u201cFinal\u201d amount of \u201cTotal Closing Costs\u201d disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(i)(1)(ii) is $12,500.35, then even though the table would appear to show a $0.35 increase in \u201cTotal Closing Costs,\u201d no statement of such increase is given under \u00a7 1026.38(i)(1)(iii) so long as the actual, non-rounded estimate (i.e., the estimated amount of \u201cTotal Closing Costs\u201d that would have been shown on the Loan Estimate to two decimal places) is equal to $12,500.35.",

If the creditor provides revised disclosures reflecting the new program and including the appraisal fee, then the actual appraisal fee will be compared to the appraisal fee included in the revised disclosures to determine if the actual fee has increased above the estimated fee. However, if the revised disclosures also include increased estimates for title fees, the actual title fees must be compared to the original estimates assuming that the increased title fees do not stem from the change in eligibility or any other change warranting a revised disclosure.

For example, if the creditor requires homeowner\u2019s insurance but fails to include a homeowner\u2019s insurance premium on the estimates provided pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), then the creditor\u2019s failure to disclose does not comply with \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(iii).

If, however, the creditor estimates consistent with the best information reasonably available that the loan will close on the 30th of the month and bases the estimate of prepaid interest accordingly, but the loan actually closed on the 1st of the next month instead, the creditor complies with \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(iii).",

Section 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(A) also provides that if the mortgage broker provides the required disclosures, it must comply with all relevant requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e). This means that \u201cmortgage broker\u201d should be read in the place of \u201ccreditor\u201d for all provisions of \u00a7 1026.19(e), except to the extent that such a reading would create responsibility for mortgage brokers under \u00a7 1026.19(f). To illustrate, comment 19(e)(4)(ii)\u20131 states that creditors comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(4) if the revised disclosures are reflected in the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(i). \u201cMortgage broker\u201d could not be read in place of \u201ccreditor\u201d in comment 19(e)(4)(ii)\u20131 because mortgage brokers are not responsible for the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(i). In addition, \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(A) provides that the creditor must ensure that disclosures provided by mortgage brokers comply with all requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e), and that disclosures provided by mortgage brokers that do comply with all such requirements satisfy the creditor\u2019s obligation under \u00a7 1026.19(e). The term \u201cmortgage broker,\u201d as used in \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(ii), has the same meaning as in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(2). See also comment 36(a)\u20132. Section 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(B) provides that if a mortgage broker provides any disclosure required under \u00a7 1026.19(e), the mortgage broker must also comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.25(c). For example, if a mortgage broker provides the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), it must maintain records for three years, in compliance with \u00a7 1026.25(c)(1)(i).",
