As of January 1, 2017, the most recent UIC designations were published in the second quarter of 2013, and the most recent delineation of urban areas was announced in the Federal Register in 2012, see U.S. Census Bureau, Qualifying Urban Areas for the 2010 Census, 77 FR 18652 (Mar. 27, 2012). To determine whether County Y is rural under the Bureau's definition during calendar year 2017, the creditor can use USDA-ERS's 2013 UIC designations. If County Y is not rural, the creditor can use the U.S. Census Bureau's 2012 delineation of urban areas to determine whether Census Block X is rural and is therefore a \u201crural\u201d area for purposes of \u00a7\u20091026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A).

The Bureau will post on its public Web site the applicable lists for each calendar year by the end of that year and publish such lists in the Federal Register, to assist creditors in ascertaining the availability to them of the exemption during the following year.

Because covered transactions are \u201ctransactions secured by a dwelling,\u201d consistent with \u00a7 1026.2(a)(17)(v), an affiliate regularly extended covered transactions if it extended more than five covered transactions in a calendar year. Also consistent with \u00a7 1026.2(a)(17)(v), because a covered transaction may be a high-cost mortgage subject to \u00a7 1026.32, an affiliate regularly extends covered transactions if, in any 12-month period, it extends more than one covered transaction that is subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1026.32 or one or more such transactions through a mortgage broker. Thus, if a creditor's affiliate regularly extended first-lien covered transactions during the preceding calendar year, the creditor's assets as of the end of the preceding calendar year, for purposes of the asset limit, take into account the assets of that affiliate.
