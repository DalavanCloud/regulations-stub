In contrast, if the firm commitment does not exceed the threshold amount at account opening, the account is not exempt under \u00a7 1026.3(b) even if the account balance later exceeds the threshold amount. In addition, if a creditor reduces a firm commitment, the account ceases to be exempt unless the reduced firm commitment exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of the reduction.
