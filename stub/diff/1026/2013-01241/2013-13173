The conditions specified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(1) and (2) are determined according to activity that occurred in the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the consumer's application was received. Section 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(2) provides that, during the preceding calendar year, the creditor must have extended credit only to consumers with income that did not exceed the limit then in effect for low- and moderate-income households, as specified in regulations prescribed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to 24 CFR 570.3. For example, a creditor has satisfied the requirement in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(2) if the creditor extended credit only to consumers with incomes that did not exceed the limit in effect on the dates the creditor received each consumer's individual application. The condition specified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(3), which relates to the current extension of credit, provides that the extension of credit must be to a consumer with income that does not exceed the limit specified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(2) in effect on the date the creditor received the consumer's application.

For example, a qualified mortgage under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(5) may not have a loan term in excess of 30 years because longer terms are prohibited for qualified mortgages under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(2)(ii). Similarly, a qualified mortgage under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(5) may not result in a balloon payment because \u00a7 1026.43(e)(2)(i)(C) provides that qualified mortgages may not have balloon payments except as provided under \u00a7 1026.43(f). However, a covered transaction need not comply with \u00a7 1026.43(e)(2)(vi), which prohibits consumer monthly debt-to-income ratios in excess of 43 percent. A covered transaction therefore can be a qualified mortgage under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(5) even though the consumer's monthly debt-to-income ratio is greater than 43 percent.",
