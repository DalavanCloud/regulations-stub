For example, \u201cmonthly interest accrual amortization\u201d treats each payment as made on the scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid early or late (until the expiration of any grace period). Thus, under the terms of a loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or on May 10. In this example, if the consumer prepays the loan in full on April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a prepayment penalty of $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20 is only $2,000.",

If a county satisfies either test, the Bureau will include the county on a published list of counties that are rural or underserved as defined by \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A)(1) or \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B) for a particular calendar year, even if the county contains census blocks that are designated by the Census Bureau as urban. To facilitate compliance with appraisal requirements in \u00a7 1026.35(c), the Bureau also creates a list of those counties that are rural under the Bureau's definition without regard to whether the counties are underserved. To the extent that U.S. territories are treated by the Census Bureau as counties and are neither metropolitan statistical areas nor micropolitan statistical areas adjacent to metropolitan statistical areas, such territories will be included on these lists as rural areas in their entireties. The Bureau will post on its public Web site the applicable lists for each calendar year by the end of that year and publish such lists in the Federal Register, to assist creditors in ascertaining the availability to them of the exemption during the following year. Any county that the Bureau includes on its published lists of counties that are rural or underserved under the Bureau's definitions for a particular year is deemed to qualify as a rural or underserved area for that calendar year for purposes of \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv), even if the county contains census blocks that are designated by the Census Bureau as urban. A property located in such a listed county is deemed to be located in a rural or underserved area, even if the census block in which the property is located is designated as urban.",

Assume that, under the terms of the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card, a consumer is required to pay $120 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit at account opening. The consumer is also required to pay a cash advance fee that is equal to 5 percent of any cash advance and a late payment fee of $15 if the required minimum periodic payment is not received by the payment due date (which is the 25th of the month). At credit account opening on March 1 of year one, the credit limit for the account is $500. Section 1026.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge to the account the $120 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit at account opening. On April 1 of year one, the consumer uses the account for a $100 cash advance. Section 1026.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge a $5 cash advance fee to the account. On April 26 of year one, the card issuer has not received the consumer's required minimum periodic payment. Section 1026.52(a)(2) permits the card issuer to charge a $15 late payment fee to the account. On July 15 of year one, the consumer uses the account for a $50 cash advance. Section 1026.52(a)(1) does not permit the card issuer to charge a $2.50 cash advance fee to the account, because the total amount of non-exempt fees reached the 25 percent limit with the $5 cash advance fee on April 1 (the $15 late fee on April 26 is exempt pursuant to \u00a7\u20091026.52(a)(2)(i)). Furthermore, \u00a7\u20091026.52(a)(1) prohibits the card issuer from collecting the $2.50 cash advance fee from the consumer by other means.",

In many cases, the creditor cannot determine, at the time the disclosure is made, whether a loan may be assumable at a future date on its original terms. For example, the assumption clause commonly used in mortgages sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation conditions an assumption on a variety of factors, such as the creditworthiness of the subsequent borrower, the potential for impairment of the creditor\u2019s security, and the execution of an assumption agreement by the subsequent borrower. If the creditor can determine that such assumption is not permitted, the creditor complies with \u00a7 1026.37(m)(2) by disclosing that the loan is not assumable. In all other situations, including where assumption of a loan is permitted or is dependent on certain conditions or factors, or uncertainty exists as to the future assumability of a mortgage loan, the creditor complies with \u00a7 1026.37(m)(2) by disclosing that, under certain conditions, the creditor may allow a third party to assume the loan on its original terms.",

In these circumstances, the creditor must comply with all of the applicable requirements of this part with respect to the year ten transaction if the original loan is satisfied and replaced by the new loan, which is not exempt under \u00a7 226.3(b).

For the first five years of the loan term, the scheduled payments cover only interest and the loan has an introductory interest rate that is fixed at 4.00 percent. After five years, the payments include principal and the interest rate adjusts every three years based on the value of the Monthly Treasury Average index plus a margin of 4.00 percent. The consumer has elected to lock the interest rate. The creditor does not require an escrow account with the loan. The creditor requires that the consumer pay for private mortgage insurance.",

For example, assume that at consummation the consumer must pay four itemized charges that are subject to the good faith determination under \u00a7\u20091026.19(e)(3)(i). If the actual amounts paid by the consumer for the four itemized charges subject to \u00a7\u20091026.19(e)(3)(i) exceed their respective estimates on the disclosures required under \u00a7\u20091026.19(e)(1)(i) by $30, $25, $25, and $15, then the total would exceed the limitations prescribed by \u00a7\u20091026.19(e)(3)(i) by $95. If, further, the amounts paid by the consumer for services that are subject to the good faith determination under \u00a7\u20091026.19(e)(3)(ii) totaled $1,190, but the respective estimates on the disclosures required under \u00a7\u20091026.19(e)(1)(i) totaled only $1,000, then the total would exceed the limitations prescribed by \u00a7\u20091026.19(e)(3)(ii) by $90. The creditor does not violate \u00a7\u20091026.19(e)(1)(i) if the creditor refunds $185 to the consumer no later than 60 days after consummation. The creditor does not violate \u00a7\u20091026.19(f)(1)(i) if the creditor delivers or places in the mail corrected disclosures reflecting the $185 refund of the excess amount collected no later than 60 days after consummation.

This exclusion applies to a construction-only loan as well as to the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan. Section 1026.35(c) does apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different creditor, unless the permanent financing is otherwise exempt from the requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(c). See \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2). When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the general disclosure requirements for closed-end credit (\u00a7 1026.17) provide that the creditor may give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See \u00a7 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) and comment 17(c)(6)-2. Section 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) addresses only how a creditor may elect to disclose a construction-to-permanent transaction. Which disclosure option a creditor elects under \u00a7 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) does not affect the determination of whether the permanent phase of the transaction is subject to \u00a7 1026.35(c). When the creditor discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under \u00a7 1026.35(c). When the creditor discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with \u00a7 1026.35 and appendix D to part 1026. The annual percentage rate must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under \u00a7 1026.35(c). If the transaction is determined to be a higher-priced mortgage loan not otherwise exempt under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2), only the permanent phase is subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(c).",

If the transaction includes a prepayment penalty, \u00a7 1026.37(b)(7) sets forth the information that must be disclosed under \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4) (i.e., the maximum amount of the prepayment penalty that may be imposed under the terms of the loan contract and the date on which the penalty will no longer be imposed). For an example of such disclosure, see form H\u201324 of appendix H to this part. The disclosure under \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4) applies to transactions where the terms of the loan contract provide for a prepayment penalty, even though the creditor does not know at the time of the disclosure whether the consumer will, in fact, make a payment to the creditor that would cause imposition of the penalty. For example, if the monthly interest accrual amortization method described in comment 37(b)(4)\u20132.i is used such that interest is assessed on the balance for a full month even if the consumer makes a full prepayment before the end of the month, the transaction includes a prepayment penalty that must be disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4).",

Finance charges that do not take into account each reduction in the principal balance of an obligation may include precomputed finance charges. If any portion of an unearned precomputed finance charge will not be provided as a rebate upon full prepayment, the disclosure required by \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4) will be an affirmative answer, indicate the maximum amount of such precomputed finance charge that may not be provided as a rebate to the consumer upon any prepayment, and state when the period during which a full rebate would not be provided terminates, as required by \u00a7 1026.37(b)(7). If, instead, there will be a full rebate of the precomputed finance charge and no other prepayment penalty imposed on the consumer, to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4) and (7), the creditor states a negative answer only. If the transaction involves both a precomputed finance charge and a finance charge computed by application of a rate to an unpaid balance, disclosure about both the entitlement to any rebate of the finance charge upon prepayment and any other prepayment penalty are made as one disclosure under \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4), stating one affirmative or negative answer and an aggregated amount and time period for the information required by \u00a7 1026.37(b)(7). For example, if in such a transaction, a portion of the precomputed finance charge will not be provided as a rebate and the loan contract also provides for a prepayment penalty based on the amount prepaid, both disclosures are made under \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4) as one aggregate amount, stating the maximum amount and time period under \u00a7 1026.37(b)(7). If the transaction instead provides a rebate of the precomputed finance charge upon prepayment, but imposes a prepayment penalty based on the amount prepaid, to comply with \u00a7 1026.37(b)(4), the creditor states an affirmative answer and the information about the prepayment penalty, as required by \u00a7 1026.37(b)(7).

The disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.39(d)(5) apply only to a mortgage loan that is a closed-end consumer credit credit transaction secured by a dwelling or real property and that is not a reverse mortgage transaction subject to \u00a7 1026.33. In an open-end consumer credit credit transaction secured by the consumer\u2019s principal dwelling, \u00a7 1026.39(d) requires covered person to provide the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.39(d)(1) through (4), but not the partial payment policy disclosure required by \u00a7 1026.39(d)(5). If, however, the dwelling in the open-end consumer credit credit transaction is not the consumer\u2019s principal dwelling (e.g., it is used solely for vacation purposes), none of the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.39(d) is required because the transaction is not a mortgage loan for purposes of \u00a7 1026.39. See \u00a7 1026.39(a)(2). In contrast, a closed-end consumer credit credit transaction secured by the consumer\u2019s dwelling that is not the consumer\u2019s principal dwelling is considered a mortgage loan for purposes of \u00a7 1026.39. Assuming that the transaction is not a reverse mortgage transaction subject to \u00a7 1026.33, \u00a7 1026.39(d) requires a covered person to provide the disclosures under \u00a7 1026.39(d)(1) through (5). But if the transaction is a reverse mortgage transaction subject to \u00a7 1026.33, \u00a7 1026.39(d) requires a covered person to provide only the disclosures under \u00a7 1026.39(d)(1) through (4).",

The data submitted by the creditor at the time of loan delivery indicated that the various loan terms met the product type, weighted-average coupon, weighted-average maturity, and other MBS pooling criteria, and MBS issuance disclosures to investors reflected this loan data. However, after delivery and MBS issuance, a quality control review determines that the loan violates the pooling criteria. The loan still meets eligibility requirements for Fannie Mae products and loan terms. Fannie Mae, however, requires the creditor to repurchase the loan due to the violation of MBS pooling requirements. Assume that the quality control review determination is accurate.

The conditions specified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(1) and (2) are determined according to activity that occurred in the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the consumer's application was received. Section 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(2) provides that, during the preceding calendar year, the creditor must have extended credit only to consumers with income that did not exceed the limit then in effect for low- and moderate-income households, as specified in regulations prescribed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to 24 CFR 570.3. For example, a creditor has satisfied the requirement in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(2) if the creditor extended credit only to consumers with incomes that did not exceed the limit in effect on the dates the creditor received each consumer's individual application. The condition specified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(3), which relates to the current extension of credit, provides that the extension of credit must be to a consumer with income that does not exceed the limit specified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(2) in effect on the date the creditor received the consumer's application. For example, assume that a creditor with a tax exemption ruling under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 has satisfied the conditions identified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(1) and (2). If, on May 21, 2014, the creditor in this example extends credit secured by a dwelling to a consumer whose application reflected income in excess of the limit identified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(2) in effect on the date the creditor received that consumer's application, the creditor has not satisfied the condition in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(3) and this extension of credit is not exempt from the requirements of \u00a7 1026.43(c) through (f).",

For this purpose, \u201cpast due\u201d means the failure to make a periodic payment (in one full payment or in two or more partial payments) sufficient to cover principal, interest, and, if applicable, escrow under the terms of the legal obligation. Other amounts, such as any late fees, are not considered for this purpose. For purposes of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(3), a periodic payment is 30 days past due when it is not paid on or before the due date of the following scheduled periodic payment and is 60 days past due when, after already becoming 30 days past due, it is not paid on or before the due date of the next scheduled periodic payment. For purposes of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(3), the creditor or assignee may treat a received payment as applying to the oldest outstanding periodic payment. The following example illustrates the meaning of 60 days past due for purposes of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(3):",

Qualified mortgage status under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4) depends on whether a loan is eligible to be purchased, guaranteed, or insured at the time of consummation, provided that other requirements under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4) are satisfied. Some repurchase or indemnification demands are not related to eligibility criteria at consummation. See comment 43(e)(4)-4. Further, even where a repurchase or indemnification demand relates to whether the loan satisfied relevant eligibility requirements as of the time of consummation, the mere fact that a demand has been made, or even resolved, between a creditor and GSE or agency is not dispositive for purposes of \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4). However, evidence of whether a particular loan satisfied the \u00a7 1026.43(e)(4) eligibility criteria at consummation may be brought to light in the course of dealing over a particular demand, depending on the facts and circumstances. Accordingly, each loan should be evaluated by the creditor based on the facts and circumstances relating to the eligibility of that loan at the time of consummation. For example:",

For example, a war or a natural disaster would be an extraordinary event beyond the control of an interested party. A changed circumstance may also be an unexpected event specific to the consumer or the transaction. For example, if the creditor provided an estimate of title insurance on the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), but the title insurer goes out of business during underwriting, then this unexpected event specific to the transaction is a changed circumstance. A changed circumstance may also be information specific to the consumer or transaction that the creditor relied upon when providing the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and that was inaccurate or changed after the disclosures were provided. For example, if the creditor relied on the consumer\u2019s income when providing the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), and the consumer represented to the creditor that the consumer had an annual income of $90,000, but underwriting determines that the consumer\u2019s annual income is only $80,000, then this inaccuracy in information relied upon is a changed circumstance. Or, assume two co-applicants applied for a mortgage loan. One applicant\u2019s income was $30,000, while the other applicant\u2019s income was $50,000. If the creditor relied on the combined income of $80,000 when providing the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), but the applicant earning $30,000 becomes unemployed during underwriting, thereby reducing the combined income to $50,000, then this change in information relied upon is a changed circumstance. A changed circumstance may also be the discovery of new information specific to the consumer or transaction that the creditor did not rely on when providing the original disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i). For example, if the creditor relied upon the value of the property in providing the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), but during underwriting a neighbor of the seller, upon learning of the impending sale of the property, files a claim contesting the boundary of the property to be sold, then this new information specific to the transaction is a changed circumstance.",

Because covered transactions are \u201ctransactions secured by a dwelling,\u201d consistent with \u00a7 1026.2(a)(17)(v), an affiliate regularly extended covered transactions if it extended more than five covered transactions in a calendar year. Also consistent with \u00a7 1026.2(a)(17)(v), because a covered transaction may be a high-cost mortgage subject to \u00a7 1026.32, an affiliate regularly extends covered transactions if, in any 12-month period, it extends more than one covered transaction that is subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1026.32 or one or more such transactions through a mortgage broker. Thus, if a creditor's affiliate regularly extended first-lien covered transactions during the preceding calendar year, the creditor's assets as of the end of the preceding calendar year, for purposes of the asset limit, take into account the assets of that affiliate. If the creditor, together with its affiliates that regularly extended first-lien covered transactions, exceeded the asset limit in the preceding calendar year\u2014to be eligible to operate as a small creditor for transactions with applications received before April 1 of the current calendar year\u2014the assets of the creditor's affiliates that regularly extended covered transactions in the year before the preceding calendar year are included in calculating the creditor's assets.",

See section \u00a7 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) and associated commentary for guidance regarding when the negative amortization period ends for purposes of \u00a7 1026.37(c)(2). For example, if the maximum principal balance for the last payment in the negative amortization period is achieved at an interest rate that is not the maximum interest rate permitted under the terms of the legal obligation before the negative amortization period ends, future events requiring disclosure of additional, separate periodic payments or ranges of payments assume that the interest rate in effect at the end of the negative amortization period was such interest rate, and not the maximum possible interest rate. After the end of the negative amortization period, the general rule under \u00a7 1026.37(c)(2)(i)(A) regarding assumptions of interest rate changes for the maximum principal and interest payment to be disclosed applies from such interest rate. The minimum payment in an adjustable rate loan that contains a negative amortization feature is determined pursuant to the general rule under \u00a7 1026.37(c)(2)(i)(A).",

If during the 30-day period following consummation, an event in connection with the settlement of the transaction occurs that causes such disclosures to become inaccurate and such inaccuracy results in a change to the amount actually paid by the seller from that amount disclosed under \u00a7 1026.19(f)(4)(i), the settlement agent shall deliver or place in the mail corrected disclosures not later than 30 days after receiving information sufficient to establish that such event has occurred. Section 1026.19(f)(4)(i) requires disclosure of the items that relate to the seller\u2019s transaction. Thus, the settlement agent need only redisclose if an item related to the seller\u2019s transaction becomes inaccurate and such inaccuracy results in a change to the amount actually paid by the seller. For example, assume a transaction where the seller pays the transfer tax, the consummation occurs on Monday, and the security instrument is recorded on Tuesday, the day after consummation. If the settlement agent receives information on Tuesday sufficient to establish that transfer taxes owed to the State differ from those disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(f)(4)(i), the settlement agent complies with \u00a7 1026.19(f)(4)(ii) by revising the disclosures accordingly and delivering or placing them in the mail not later than 30 days after Tuesday. See comment 19(e)(4)(i)\u20131 for guidance on when sufficient information has been received to establish an event has occurred.

Under \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.37(c) and 1026.38(c), the creditor must disclose the periodic payments during the construction phase in a projected payments table.

            "text":"Scope of \u00a7\u20091026.61.Section 1026.61 sets forth the definition of hybrid prepaid-credit card, and several requirements that only apply to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i). Hybrid prepaid-credit cards and covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards are also subject to other rules in this regulation, and some of those rules and related commentary contain specific guidance related to hybrid prepaid-credit cards and covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. For example, as discussed in \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) and 1026.61(a), a hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card for purposes of this regulation with respect to a covered separate credit feature. A covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card also will be a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan as defined in \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(ii) if the covered separate credit feature is an open-end credit plan. Thus, the provisions in this regulation that apply to credit cards and credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan generally will apply to hybrid prepaid-credit cards and covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as applicable (see generally subparts B and G). Some of those rules and related commentary contain specific guidance with respect to hybrid prepaid-credit cards and covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) and (ii), 1026.4(b)(11), (c)(3) and (4), 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) and (E), 1026.7(b)(11)(ii)(A), 1026.12(d)(3)(ii), 1026.13(i)(2), 1026.60(a)(5)(iv) and (b), and related commentary to these and other rules in the regulation.",

A creditor may find that, even though it developed an averagecost pricing program in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(f)(3)(ii), over time it has collected more from consumers than it has paid to settlement service providers. For example, assume a creditor defines a class of transactions and uses that class to develop an average charge of $135 for pest inspections. The creditor then charges $135 per transaction for 100 transactions from January 1 through April 30, but the actual average cost to the creditor of pest inspections during this period is $115. The creditor then decreases the average charge for the May to August period to account for the lower average cost during the January to April period. At this point, the creditor has collected $2,000 more than it has paid to settlement service providers for pest inspections. The creditor then charges $115 per transaction for 70 transactions from May 1 to August 30, but the actual average cost to the creditor of pest inspections during this period is $125. Based on the average cost to the creditor from the May to August period, the average charge to the consumer for the September to December period should be $125. However, while the creditor spent $700 more than it collected during the May to August period, it collected $1,300 more than it spent from January to August. In cases such as these, the creditor remains responsible for ensuring that the amount collected from consumers does not exceed the total amounts paid for the corresponding settlement services over time. The creditor may develop a variety of methods that achieve this outcome. For example, the creditor may choose to refund the proportional overage paid to the affected consumers. Or the creditor may choose to factor in the excess amount collected to decrease the average charge for an upcoming period. Although any method may comply with this requirement, a creditor is deemed to have complied if it defines a six-month time period and establishes a rolling monthly period of reevaluation. For example, assume a creditor defines a six-month time period from January 1 to June 30 and the creditor uses the average charge starting July 1. If, at the end of July, the creditor recalculates the average cost from February 1 to July 31, and then uses the recalculated average cost for transactions starting August 1, the creditor complies with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(f)(3)(ii), even if the creditor actually collected more from consumers than was paid to providers over time.",

For example, assume a creditor calculates an average tax certification fee based on four-month periods starting January 1 of each year. The tax certification fees charged to a consumer on May 20 may not exceed the average tax certification fee paid from January 1 through April 30. A creditor may delay the period by a reasonable amount of time if such delay is needed to perform the necessary analysis and update the affected systems, provided that each subsequent period is scheduled accordingly. For example, a creditor may define a fourmonth period from January 1 to April 30 and begin using the average charge from that period on May 15, provided the average charge is used until September 15, at which time the average charge for the period from May 1 to August 31 becomes effective.",

            "text":"If the loan has an adjustable rate under which the regular periodic payments may increase after consummation, but the amounts of such payment increases (if any) are unknown at the time of consummation, then the regular periodic payments are based on the fully-indexed rate, except as otherwise determined by any premium or discounted rates, the application of any interest rate adjustment caps, or any other known, scheduled rates under the terms specified in the loan contract. For analogous guidance, see comments 17(c)(1)\u20138 and \u201310. Similarly, if a loan has an adjustable interest rate which does not adjust the regular periodic payment but would, if the rate increased, increase only the final payment, the amount of the final payment for purposes of the balloon payment determination is based on the fully-indexed rate, except as otherwise determined by any premium or discounted rate caps, or any other known, scheduled rates under the terms specified in the loan contract. For example, assume that, under a 30-year adjustable rate mortgage, (1) the loan contract requires monthly payments of $300 during years one through five, (2) the loan contract permits interest rate increases every three years starting in the sixth year up to the fully-indexed rate, subject to caps on interest rate adjustments specified in the loan contract, (3) based on the application of the interest rate adjustment caps, the interest rate may increase to the fullyindexed rate starting in year nine, and (4) the monthly payment based on the fully-indexed rate is $700. The regular periodic payments during years one through five are $300 per month, because they are known and scheduled. The regular periodic payments during years six through eight are up to $700 per month, based on the fully-indexed rate but subject to the application of interest rate adjustment caps specified under the loan contract. The regular periodic payments during years nine through thirty are $700, based on the fully-indexed rate. Therefore, if an irregular payment of $1,000 is scheduled during the final month of year 30, that payment is disclosed as a balloon payment under \u00a7 1026.37(b)(5), because it is more than two times the regular periodic payment amount of $300 during years one through five. This is the case even though the irregular payment is not more than two times the regular periodic payment during years nine through thirty (i.e., based on the fully-indexed rate). However, the regular periodic payments during years six through thirty themselves are not balloon payments, even though they may be more than two times the regular periodic payments during years one through five.",

Comment 37(f)-3 states that such inspection and handling fees are loan costs associated with the transaction for purposes of \u00a7\u20091026.37(f) and, as such, must be disclosed accurately as part of the Loan Estimate. These fees must also be disclosed accurately as part of the Closing Disclosure. Comment 38(f)-2 refers to explanations under comments 37(f)-3 and 37(f)(6)-3 for making these disclosures. Comment 37(f)-3 explains that, if such fees are collected at or before consummation, they are disclosed in the loan costs table. If such fees will be collected after consummation, they are disclosed in a separate addendum and are not counted for purposes of the calculating cash to close table. Comment 37(f)(6)-3 explains how to disclose inspection and handling fees that will be collected after consummation in an addendum. Under comment 38(f)-2, the same explanation applies to an addendum used for disclosing such fees in the Closing Disclosure. Comment 37(l)(1)-1 explains that the amount disclosed under \u00a7\u20091026.37(l)(1)1026.37(l)(1)(i) is the sum of principal, interest, mortgage insurance, and loan costs scheduled to be paid through the end of the 60th month after the due date of the first periodic payment, and that loan costs are those costs disclosed under \u00a7\u20091026.37(f).

There are two elements to satisfying \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C). First, a nonprofit entity must service 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans, including any mortgage loans serviced on behalf of associated nonprofit entities. For each associated nonprofit entity, the small servicer determination is made separately, without consideration of the number of loans serviced by another associated nonprofit entity. Second, a nonprofit entity must service only mortgage loans for which the servicer (or an associated nonprofit entity) is the creditor. To be the creditor, the servicer (or an associated nonprofit entity) must have been the entity to which the mortgage loan obligation was initially payable (that is, the originator of the mortgage loan). A nonprofit entity is not a small servicer under \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C) if it services any mortgage loans for which the servicer (or an associated nonprofit entity) is not the creditor (that is, for which the servicer or an associated nonprofit entity was not the originator). The first of the following two examples demonstrates circumstances in which a nonprofit entity would qualify as a small servicer under \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C) because it meets both requirements for determining a nonprofit entity's status as a small servicer under \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C). The second example demonstrates circumstances in which a nonprofit entity would not qualify as a small servicer under \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C) because it does not meet both requirements under \u00a7 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C).",

A qualified mortgage under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(5) retains its qualified mortgage status if it is sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred to another person pursuant to: A capital restoration plan or other action under 12 U.S.C. 1831o; the actions or instructions of any person acting as conservator, receiver or bankruptcy trustee; an order of a State or Federal government agency with jurisdiction to examine the creditor pursuant to State or Federal law; or an agreement between the creditor and such an agency. A qualified mortgage under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(5) that is sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred under these circumstances retains its qualified mortgage status regardless of how long after consummation it is sold and regardless of the size or other characteristics of the transferee. Section 1026.43(e)(5)(ii)(C) does not apply to transfers done to comply with a generally applicable regulation with future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy in the absence of a specific order by or a specific agreement with a governmental agency described in \u00a7 1026.43(e)(5)(ii)(C) directing the sale of one or more qualified mortgages under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(5) held by the creditor or one of the other circumstances listed in \u00a7 1026.43(e)(5)(ii)(C). For example, a qualified mortgage under \u00a7 1026.43(e)(5) that is sold pursuant to a capital restoration plan under 12 U.S.C. 1831o would retain its status as a qualified mortgage following the sale. However, if the creditor simply chose to sell the same qualified mortgage as one way to comply with general regulatory capital requirements in the absence of supervisory action or agreement it would lose its status as a qualified mortgage following the sale unless it qualifies under another definition of qualified mortgage.",

In a purchase or refinancing transaction, in the event the amount of the credit extended by the creditor has decreased and therefore caused the \u201cDown Payment/Funds from Borrower\u201d amount to increase, the statement can read, for example, \u201cYou increased this payment. See details in Section L,\u201d with the same in boldface.",

To explain further, loans enumerated in \u00a7 1026.43(a) are not \u201ccovered transaction\u201d under the Bureau\u2019s ability-to-repay requirements in \u00a7 1026.43, and thus cannot be qualified mortgages (entitled to a rebuttable presumption or safe harbor of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements of \u00a7 1026.43, see, e.g., \u00a7 1026.43(e)(1)). These include an extension of credit made pursuant to a program administered by a Housing Finance Agency, as defined under 24 CFR 266.5, or pursuant to a program authorized by sections 101 and 109 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. See \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(iv) and (vi). They also include extensions of credit made by a creditor identified in \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v). However, these loans are eligible for the exemption in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(i) if they meet the Bureau\u2019s qualified mortgage criteria in \u00a7 1026.43(e)(2), (4), (5), or (6) or \u00a7 1026.43(f) (including limits on when loans must be consummated) or, for loans that are insured, guaranteed, or administered by HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS, in applicable rules prescribed by those agencies (but only once such rules are in effect; otherwise, the Bureau\u2019s criteria for a qualified mortgage applies to those loans). For example, assume that HUD has prescribed rules to define loans insured under its programs that are qualified mortgages and those rules are in effect. Assume further that a creditor designated as a Community Development Financial Institution, as defined under 12 CFR 1805.104(h), originates a loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which is a part of HUD. The loan is not a \u201ccovered transaction\u201d and thus is not a qualified mortgage. See \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(A) and (b)(1). Nonetheless, the transaction is eligible for an exemption from the appraisal requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(c) if it meets the qualified mortgage criteria in HUD\u2019s rules. Nothing in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(i) alters the definition of a qualified mortgage under regulations of the Bureau, HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS.",

Non-specific lender credits are generalized payments from the creditor to the consumer that do not pay for a particular fee on the disclosures provided pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1). Specific lender credits are specific payments, such as a credit, rebate, or reimbursement, from a creditor to the consumer to pay for a specific fee. Nonspecific lender credits and specific lender credits are negative charges to the consumer. The actual total amount of lender credits, whether specific or non-specific, provided by the creditor that is less than the estimated \u201clender credits\u201d identified in \u00a7 1026.37(g)(6)(ii) and disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e) is an increased charge to the consumer for purposes of determining good faith under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i). For example, if the creditor discloses a $750 estimate for \u201clender credits\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e), but only $500 of lender credits is actually provided to the consumer, the creditor has not complied with \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i) because the actual amount of lender credits provided is less than the estimated \u201clender credits\u201d disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e), and is therefore, an increased charge to the consumer for purposes of determining good faith under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i). However, if the creditor discloses a $750 estimate for \u201clender credits\u201d identified in \u00a7 1026.37(g)(6)(ii) to cover the cost of a $750 appraisal fee, and the appraisal fee subsequently increases by $150, and the creditor increases the amount of the lender credit by $150 to pay for the increase, the credit is not being revised in a way that violates the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i) because, although the credit increased from the amount disclosed, the amount paid by the consumer did not. However, if the creditor discloses a $750 estimate for \u201clender credits\u201d to cover the cost of a $750 appraisal fee, but subsequently reduces the credit by $50 because the appraisal fee decreased by $50, then the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(i) have been violated because, although the amount of the appraisal fee decreased, the amount of the lender credit decreased. See also \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(D) and comment 19(e)(3)(iv)(D)\u20131 for a discussion of lender credits in the context of interest rate dependent charges.",

For example, assume that, prior to providing the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), the creditor believed that the consumer was eligible for a loan program that did not require an appraisal. The creditor then provides the estimated disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), which do not include an estimated charge for an appraisal. During underwriting it is discovered that the consumer was delinquent on mortgage loan payments in the past, making the consumer ineligible for the loan program originally identified on the estimated disclosures, but the consumer remains eligible for a different program that requires an appraisal. If the creditor provides revised disclosures reflecting the new program and including the appraisal fee, then the actual appraisal fee will be compared to the appraisal fee included in the revised disclosures to determine if the actual fee has increased above the estimated fee. However, if the revised disclosures also include increased estimates for title fees, the actual title fees must be compared to the original estimates assuming that the increased title fees do not stem from the change in eligibility or any other change warranting a revised disclosure.

For example, if a creditor or other person requires the consumer to provide a $500 check to pay for a \u201cprocessing fee\u201d before the consumer receives the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), the creditor or other person does not comply with \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2)(i), even if the creditor or other person had stated that the check will not be cashed until after the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) are received by the consumer and waited until after the consumer subsequently indicated an intent to proceed to cash the check. Similarly, a creditor or other person does not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2)(i) if the creditor or other person requires the consumer to provide a credit card number before the consumer receives the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), even if the creditor or other person had promised not to charge the consumer\u2019s credit card for the $500 processing fee until after the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) are received by the consumer and waited until after the consumer subsequently indicated an intent to proceed.

These designations and delineations are updated by the USDA-ERS and the U.S. Census Bureau respectively once every ten years. As an example, assume a creditor makes first-lien covered transactions in Census Block X that is located in County Y during calendar year 2017. As of January 1, 2017, the most recent UIC designations were published in the second quarter of 2013, and the most recent delineation of urban areas was announced in the Federal Register in 2012, see U.S. Census Bureau, Qualifying Urban Areas for the 2010 Census, 77 FR 18652 (Mar. 27, 2012). To determine whether County Y is rural under the Bureau's definition during calendar year 2017, the creditor can use USDA-ERS's 2013 UIC designations. If County Y is not rural, the creditor can use the U.S. Census Bureau's 2012 delineation of urban areas to determine whether Census Block X is rural and is therefore a \u201crural\u201d area for purposes of \u00a7\u20091026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A).

The NMLSR ID is a unique number or other identifier generally assigned to individuals registered or licensed through NMLSR to provide loan originating services. For more information, see the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act) sections 1503(3) and (12) and 1504 (12 U.S.C. 5102(3) and (12) and 5103), and its implementing regulations (i.e., 12 CFR 1007.103(a) and 1008.103(a)(2)). An entity may also have an NMLSR ID. Thus, if the creditor, mortgage broker, or loan officer has obtained an NMLSR ID, the NMLSR IDs must be provided in the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.37(k)(1) and (2).",

This is true even if the draw or transfer of credit, or authorization of either, occurs during the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct person-to-person transfers. For example, assume a consumer links her prepaid account to a credit card issued by a card issuer that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner so that credit is drawn automatically into the asset feature of the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the prepaid card for which there are insufficient funds in the asset feature. In this case, the separate credit feature is a non-covered separate credit feature under \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii). In this situation, the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to the separate credit feature offered by the unrelated third-party card issuer.",

            "text":"Mortgage broker responsibilities.Section 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(A) provides that if a mortgage broker receives a consumer\u2019s application, either the creditor or the mortgage broker must provide the consumer with the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) in accordance with \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(iii). Section 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(A) also provides that if the mortgage broker provides the required disclosures, it must comply with all relevant requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e). This means that \u201cmortgage broker\u201d should be read in the place of \u201ccreditor\u201d for all provisions of \u00a7 1026.19(e), except to the extent that such a reading would create responsibility for mortgage brokers under \u00a7 1026.19(f). To illustrate, comment 19(e)(4)(ii)\u20131 states that creditors comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(4) if the revised disclosures are reflected in the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(i). \u201cMortgage broker\u201d could not be read in place of \u201ccreditor\u201d in comment 19(e)(4)(ii)\u20131 because mortgage brokers are not responsible for the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(i). In addition, \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(A) provides that the creditor must ensure that disclosures provided by mortgage brokers comply with all requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(e), and that disclosures provided by mortgage brokers that do comply with all such requirements satisfy the creditor\u2019s obligation under \u00a7 1026.19(e). The term \u201cmortgage broker,\u201d as used in \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(ii), has the same meaning as in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(2). See also comment 36(a)\u20132. Section 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(B) provides that if a mortgage broker provides any disclosure required under \u00a7 1026.19(e), the mortgage broker must also comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.25(c). For example, if a mortgage broker provides the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), it must maintain records for three years, in compliance with \u00a7 1026.25(c)(1)(i).",
