Pursuant to \u00a7 1026.58(g)(2), during the temporary suspension period set forth in \u00a7 1026.58(g)(1), a card issuer shall continue to post its agreements to its own publicly available Web site as required by \u00a7 1026.58(d) using the agreements it would have otherwise submitted to the Bureau under \u00a7 1026.58(c). For example, for purposes of \u00a7 1026.58(d)(4), a card issuer must continue to update the agreements posted on its own Web site at least as frequently as the quarterly schedule required for submission of agreements to the Bureau set forth in \u00a7 1026.58(c)(1), notwithstanding the temporary suspension of submission requirements in \u00a7 1026.58(g)(1).
