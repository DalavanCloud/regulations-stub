In transactions where paying the periodic payments will not fully amortize the outstanding balance at the end of the loan term and where the final payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance, the amount of the adjusted payment must be disclosed if such payment has changed as a result of the rate adjustment. A statement of the loan balance also is required. The balance required to be disclosed is the balance on which the new adjusted payment is based. If no payment adjustment is disclosed in the notice, the balance disclosed should be the loan balance on which the payment disclosed under \u00a7 1026.20(c)(5) is based, if applicable, or the balance at the time the disclosure is prepared.",
