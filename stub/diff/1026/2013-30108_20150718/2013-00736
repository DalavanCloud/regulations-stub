A disclosure is not required simply because a loan calls for non-amortizing or partially amortizing payments. For example, in a transaction with a five-year term and payments based on a longer amortization schedule, and where the final payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance, the creditor would not have to disclose the payment necessary to fully amortize the loan in the remainder of the five-year term. A disclosure is required, however, if the payment disclosed under \u00a7 1026.20(c)(4) is not sufficient to prevent negative amortization in the loan. The adjustment notice must state the payment required to prevent negative amortization. (This paragraph does not apply if the payment disclosed in \u00a7 1026.20(c)(4) is sufficient to prevent negative amortization in the loan but the final payment will be a different amount due to rounding.)",

See \u00a7 1026.35(a) and comment 35(a)(2)(iii)-3 for additional guidance on when a transaction's rate is set. For example, where a loan originator is a mortgage broker, a disclosure of compensation or other broker agreement required by applicable state law that complies with \u00a7 1026.25 would be presumed to be a record of the amount actually paid to the loan originator in connection with the transaction.",
