The creditor would also be required to provide the special information booklet under \u00a7 1026.19(g) of the TILA\u2013RESPA Final Rule, as applicable. Assume a creditor receives an application, as defined under \u00a7 1026.2(a)(3) of the TILA\u2013RESPA Final Rule, for a transaction subject to \u00a7 1026.19(e) and (f) on July 31, 2015, and that consummation of the transaction occurs on August 30, 2015. The amendments of the TILA\u2013RESPA Final Rule, including the requirements to provide the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure under \u00a7 1026.19(e) and (f), do not apply to the transaction, except that the provisions of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2), specifically \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2)(i), (e)(2)(ii), and (e)(2)(iii), do apply to the transaction beginning on August 1, 2015 because they become effective on August 1, 2015, without respect to whether an application, as defined under \u00a7 1026.2(a)(3) of the TILA\u2013RESPA Final Rule, has been received by the creditor or mortgage broker on that date. The creditor does not provide the Closing Disclosure so that it is received by the consumer at least three business days before consummation; instead, the creditor and the settlement agent provide the disclosures under \u00a7 1026.19(a)(2)(ii) and \u00a7 1024.8, as applicable, under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, respectively. The requirement to provide the special information booklet under \u00a7 1026.19(g) of the TILA\u2013RESPA Final Rule would also not apply to the transaction. But the creditor would provide the special information booklet under \u00a7 1024.6, as applicable.",
