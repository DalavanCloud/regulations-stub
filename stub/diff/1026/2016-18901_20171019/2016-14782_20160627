On February 1 of year one, the consumer uses the account for a $100 cash advance. Section 1026.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge a $5 cash-advance fee to the account. On March 26 of year one, the card issuer has not received the consumer's required minimum periodic payment. Section 1026.52(a)(2) permits the card issuer to charge a $15 late payment fee to the account. On July 15 of year one, the consumer uses the account for a $50 cash advance.

Assume instead a loan with a 30- year term with a payment that adjusts upward at three months and at six months and is fixed thereafter, where mortgage insurance is not required, and where no escrow account would be established for the payment of charges described in \u00a7 1026.37(c)(4)(ii). The creditor discloses as a single range of payments the initial periodic payment, the periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that occurs at three months, and the periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that occurs at six months, which single range represents the minimum payment and maximum payment, respectively, which would apply during the first year of the loan.

The settlement agent normally may rely on the representations of other parties in obtaining information, but if information about actual terms is not reasonably available, the settlement agent also must satisfy the \u201cbest information reasonably available\u201d standard. Accordingly, the settlement agent is required to exercise due diligence to obtain information if it is providing the Closing Disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(v). For example, for the loan terms table required to be disclosed under \u00a7 1026.38(b), the settlement agent would be considered to have exercised due diligence if it obtained such information from the creditor. Because the creditor remains responsible under \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(v) for ensuring that the Closing Disclosure is provided in accordance with \u00a7 1026.19(f), the creditor is expected to maintain communication with the settlement agent to ensure that the settlement agent is acting in place of the creditor. See comment 19(f)(1)(v)\u20133 for guidance on a creditor\u2019s responsibilities where a settlement agent provides disclosures.",

If the disclosures provided pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(i) do not contain the actual terms of the transaction, the creditor does not violate \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(i) if the creditor provides corrected disclosures that contain the actual terms of the transaction and complies with the other requirements of \u00a7 1026.19(f), including the timing requirements in \u00a7 1026.19(f)(1)(ii) and (f)(2).

The provisions of \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2) apply prior to a consumer's receipt of the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i), and therefore, restrict activity that may occur prior to receipt of an application by a creditor or mortgage broker under \u00a7 1026.19(e). These provisions include \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2)(i), which restricts the fees that may be imposed on a consumer, \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2)(ii), which requires a statement to be included on written estimates of terms or costs specific to a consumer, and \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2)(iii), which prohibits creditors from requiring the submission of documents verifying information related to the consumer's application. Accordingly, the provisions under \u00a7 1026.19(e)(2) are effective on October 3, 2015, without respect to whether an application has been received on that date. In addition, the amendments to \u00a7 1026.28 and the commentary to \u00a7 1026.29 govern the preemption of State laws and thus, the amendments to those provisions and associated commentary made by the TILA-RESPA Final Rule are effective on October 3, 2015, without respect to whether an application has been received on that date. The following examples illustrate the application of the effective date for the TILA-RESPA Final Rule."

Differences between the amounts of such charges disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and the amounts of such charges paid by or imposed on the consumer do not constitute a lack of good faith, so long as the original estimated charge, or lack of an estimated charge for a particular service, was based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure was provided. For example, if the consumer informs the creditor that the consumer will choose a settlement agent not identified by the creditor on the written list provided pursuant to \u00a7 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C), and the creditor subsequently discloses an unreasonably low estimated settlement agent fee, then the under-disclosure does not comply with \u00a7 1026.19(e)(3)(iii).

                "If a creditor uses appendix D and elects pursuant to \u00a7\u20091026.17(c)(6)(ii) to disclose the construction and permanent phases as separate transactions, the construction phase must be disclosed according to the rules in \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.37(c) and 1026.38(c). Under \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.37(c) and 1026.38(c), the creditor must disclose the periodic payments during the construction phase in a projected payments table. The provision in appendix D, part I.A.3, which allows the creditor to omit the number and amounts of any interest payments \u201cin disclosing the payment schedule under \u00a7\u20091026.18(g)\u201d does not apply because the transaction is governed by \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.37(c) and 1026.38(c) rather than \u00a7\u20091026.18(g). The creditor determines the amount of the interest-only payment to be made during the construction phase using the assumption in appendix D, part I.A.1. Also, because the construction phase is being disclosed as a separate transaction and its terms do not repay all principal, the creditor must disclose the construction phase transaction as a product with a balloon payment feature, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.37(a)(10)(ii)(D) and 1026.38(a)(5)(iii), in addition to reflecting the balloon payment in the projected payments table."

Because agency relationships are traditionally defined by contract and by state or other applicable law, the regulation does not define agent. Merely providing services relating to the production of credit cards or data processing for others, however, does not make one the agent of the card issuer. In contrast, a financial institution may become the agent of the card issuer if an agreement between the institution and the card issuer provides that the cardholder may use a line of credit with the financial institution to pay obligations incurred by use of the credit card."

Some creditors offer programs containing a number of different credit features. The consumer has a single account with the institution that can be accessed repeatedly via a number of sub-accounts established for the different program features and rate structures. Some features of the program might be used repeatedly (for example, an overdraft line) while others might be used infrequently (such as the part of the credit line available for secured credit). If the program as a whole is subject to prescribed terms and otherwise meets the definition of open-end credit, such a program would be considered a single, multifeatured"

Merely providing services relating to the production of credit cards or data processing for others, however, does not make one the agent of the card issuer. In contrast, a financial institution may become the agent of the card issuer if an agreement between the institution and the card issuer provides that the cardholder may use a line of credit with the financial institution to pay obligations incurred by use of the credit card."
