                    "Only the assets of a creditor's affiliate that regularly extended first-lien covered transactions during the applicable period are included in calculating the creditor's assets. The meaning of \u201cregularly extended\u201d is based on the number of times a person extends consumer credit for purposes of the definition of \u201ccreditor\u201d in \u00a7 1026.2(a)(17). Because covered transactions are \u201ctransactions secured by a dwelling,\u201d consistent with \u00a7 1026.2(a)(17)(v), an affiliate regularly extended covered transactions if it extended more than five covered transactions in a calendar year. Also consistent with \u00a7 1026.2(a)(17)(v), because a covered transaction may be a high-cost mortgage subject to \u00a7 1026.32, an affiliate regularly extends covered transactions if, in any 12-month period, it extends more than one covered transaction that is subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1026.32 or one or more such transactions through a mortgage broker. Thus, if a creditor's affiliate regularly extended first-lien covered transactions during the preceding calendar year, the creditor's assets as of the end of the preceding calendar year, for purposes of the asset limit, take into account the assets of that affiliate. If the creditor, together with its affiliates that regularly extended first-lien covered transactions, exceeded the asset limit in the preceding calendar year\u2014to be eligible to operate as a small creditor for transactions with applications received before April 1 of the current calendar year\u2014the assets of the creditor's affiliates that regularly extended covered transactions in the"
