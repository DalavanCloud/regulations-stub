If the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the remittance transfer as requested, an error has occurred. If the sender chooses the remedy to have the remittance transfer provider make the funds available to the designated recipient pursuant to \u00a7 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) and provides the corrected or additional information, the remittance transfer provider may not charge another transfer fee of US$10 to send the remittance transfer again with the corrected or additional information necessary to complete the transfer. If the intermediary institution charged a lifting fee of US$5 in the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt, the sender may choose to provide an additional amount to offset the US$5 lifting fee deducted in the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt and ensure that the designated recipient receives US$95 or may choose to resend the US$95 amount with the understanding that another US$5 fee will be deducted by the intermediary institution, as indicated in the receipt. Otherwise, if the intermediary institution did not charge a US$5 lifting fee in the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt, the provider must resend the original $100 transfer amount, and a US$5 lifting fee may be imposed by the intermediary institution, as indicated in the receipt.",
