The Bureau was authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act to define the term \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d and has done so in its 2013 ATR Final Rule. However, the 2013 ATR Final Rule does not define the types of reverse mortgage loans that should be considered \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d because, by statute, TILA's ability-to-repay rules do not apply to reverse mortgages.

As noted, high-cost mortgages will be subject to these restrictions in addition to the requirements imposed in this final rule.

Thus, any loan that triggers the high-cost mortgage provisions through the points and fees criteria could not satisfy the qualified mortgage definition. Likewise, \u00a7 1026.43(g) of this final rule provides that, where qualified mortgages are permitted to have prepayment penalties, such penalties may not be imposed more than three years after consummation or in an amount that exceeds 2 percent of the amount prepaid.
