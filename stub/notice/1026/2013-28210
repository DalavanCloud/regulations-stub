                                "TILA does not contain requirements to retain specific records, but \u00a7 1026.25 requires creditors to retain evidence of compliance with Regulation Z for two years after the date disclosures are required to be made or action is required to be taken. Section 1404 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended TILA section 129B, which imposes substantive restrictions on loan originator compensation and provides civil liability for any mortgage originator for failure to comply with the requirements of TILA section 129B and any of its implementing regulations. 15 U.S.C. 1639b(d). Section 1416(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 130(e) of TILA to provide a three-year limitations period for civil actions alleging a violation of certain sections of TILA, including section 129B concerning loan originator compensation, beginning on the date of the occurrence of the violation. 15 U.S.C. 1640(e). Prior to amendment by the Dodd-Frank Act, the limitations period for individual actions alleging violations of TILA was generally one year. 15 U.S.C. 1640(e) (2008). In view of the statutory changes to TILA, the provisions of existing \u00a7 1026.25, which impose a two-year record retention period, do not reflect the applicable limitations period for causes of action that may be brought under TILA section 129B. Moreover, the record retention provisions in \u00a7 1026.25 currently are limited to creditors, whereas the compensation restrictions in TILA section 129B, as added by the Dodd-Frank Act, cover all mortgage originators and not solely creditors.",
                                "To reflect these statutory changes, the Bureau proposed \u00a7 1026.25(c)(2), which would have made two changes to the existing record retention provisions. First, the proposed rule would have required that a creditor maintain records sufficient to evidence the compensation it pays to a loan originator and the governing compensation agreement, for three years after the date of payment. Second, the proposed rule would have required a loan originator organization to maintain for three years records of the compensation: (1) It receives from a creditor, a consumer, or another person; and (2) it pays to any individual loan originators. The loan originator organization also must maintain the compensation agreement that governs those receipts or payments for three years after the date of the receipts or payments. The Bureau proposed these changes pursuant to its authority under section 105(a) of TILA to prevent circumvention or evasion of TILA by requiring records that can be used to establish compliance. The Bureau stated its belief that these proposed modifications would ensure records associated with loan originator compensation are retained for a time period commensurate with the statute of limitations for causes of action under TILA section 130 and are readily available for examination. In addition, the Bureau stated its belief that the modifications are necessary to prevent circumvention of and to facilitate compliance with TILA.",
                                "The Bureau recognized that increasing the period a creditor must retain records for specific information related to loan originator compensation from two years, as currently provided in Regulation Z, to three years may impose some marginal increase in the creditor's compliance burden in the form of incremental cost of storage. The Bureau stated its belief, however, that creditors should be able to use existing recordkeeping systems to maintain the records for an additional year at minimal cost. Similarly, although loan originator organizations would incur some costs to establish and maintain recordkeeping systems, the Bureau expected that loan originator organizations would be able to adopt at minimal cost their existing recordkeeping systems to serve these newly required purposes. During the Small Business Review Panel, the Small Entity Representatives were asked about their current record retention practices and the potential impact of the proposed enhanced record retention requirements. Of the few Small Entity Representatives that provided feedback on the issue, one creditor Small Entity Representative stated that it maintained detailed records of compensation paid to all of its employees and that a regulator already reviews its compensation plans regularly. Another creditor Small Entity Representative reported that it did not believe that the proposed record retention requirement would require it to change its current practices.",
                                "In addition, the Bureau recognized that applying the existing two-year record retention period to information specified in \u00a7 1026.25(c)(2) could adversely affect the ability of consumers to bring actions under TILA. As the Bureau stated in the proposal, the extension also would serve to reduce litigation risk and maintain consistency between creditors and loan originator organizations. The Bureau therefore believed that it was appropriate to expand the time period for record retention to effectuate the three-year statute of limitations period established by Congress for actions against loan originators under section 129B of TILA.",
                                "Most commenters agreed that extending the retention period from two years to three years would not significantly increase the cost of compliance. Though some commenters opined that the changes in \u00a7 1026.25(c) would significantly increase their compliance burden, those comments appeared to be directed to the proposed record retention provisions related to proposed restrictions on discount points and origination points or fees in proposed \u00a7 1026.36(d)(2)(ii). Because the Bureau is not finalizing in this rule the points and fees proposal (or the attendant record retention requirement), the additional record retention requirement imposed by this final rule is minimal.",
                                "The Bureau invited public comment on whether a record retention period of five years, rather than three years, would be appropriate. The Bureau explained that relevant actions and compensation practices that must be evidenced in retained records may in some cases occur prior to the beginning of the three-year period of enforceability that applies to a particular transaction. In addition, the running of the three-year period may be tolled under some circumstances, resulting in a period of enforceability that ends more than three years following an occurrence of a violation of applicable requirements. Accordingly, the proposal stated that a record retention period that is longer than three years may help ensure that consumers are able to avail themselves of TILA protections while imposing minimal incremental burden on creditors and loan originators. The Bureau noted that many State and local laws related to transactions involving real property may set a record retention period, or may depend on the information being available, for five years. Additionally, a five-year record retention period would be consistent with proposed provisions in the Bureau's 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal.",
                                "Most commenters objected to a five-year record retention period as overly burdensome. In addition, the implementing regulations of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) require that there be a showing of \u201csubstantial need\u201d to impose a record retention requirement of longer than three years. 5 CFR 1320.5(d)(2)(iv). Given the PRA's preference for retention periods of three years or less, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1026.25(c)(2)'s three-year retention period as proposed, notwithstanding some of the noted advantages of a longer retention period.\n            \n          "

Although creditors would retain some of the records needed to demonstrate compliance with TILA section 129B and its implementing regulations, in some circumstances, the records would be available solely from the loan originator organization. For example, if a creditor compensates a loan originator organization for originating a transaction and the loan originator organization in turn allocates a portion of that compensation to an individual loan originator as a commission, the creditor may not possess a copy of the commission agreement setting forth the arrangement between the loan originator organization and the individual loan originator or any record of the payment of the commission. The Bureau stated that applying this requirement to both creditors and loan originator organizations would prevent circumvention of and facilitate compliance with TILA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act.",

Although section 129B(d) of TILA, as added by the Dodd-Frank Act, permits consumers to bring actions against mortgage originators (which include individual loan originators), the Bureau stated its belief that applying the record retention requirements of \u00a7 1026.25 to individual loan originators is unnecessary. Under \u00a7 1026.25 as proposed, loan originator organizations and creditors would have been required to retain certain records regarding all of their individual loan originators. The preamble stated that applying the same record retention requirements to the individual loan originator employees themselves would be duplicative. In addition, such a requirement might not be feasible in all cases, because individual loan originators might not have access to the types of records required to be retained under \u00a7 1026.25, particularly after they cease to be employed by the creditor or loan originator organization. Under the proposal, an individual loan originator who is a sole proprietor, however, would have been responsible for compliance with provisions that apply to the proprietorship (which is a loan originator organization) and, as a result, is responsible for compliance with the record retention requirements. Similarly, a natural person who is a creditor would have been subject to the requirements that apply to creditors.",

                                "Proposed comment 25(c)(2)-1.i would have clarified that, under \u00a7 1026.25(c)(2), records are sufficient to evidence that compensation was paid and received if they demonstrate facts enumerated in the comment. The comment gives examples of the types of records that, depending on the facts and circumstances, may be sufficient to evidence compliance. One commenter expressed concern that the comment could be read to require retention of all records listed; however, the comment clearly states that the records listed are examples only and what records would be sufficient would be dependent on the facts and circumstances and would vary on a case-by-case basis. To prevent any uncertainty, however, the comment is clarified to describe which records might be sufficient depending on the type of compensation at issue in certain circumstances. For example, the comment explains that, for compensation in the form of a contribution to or benefit under a designated tax-advantaged retirement plan, records to be maintained might include copies of required filings under other applicable statutes relating to such plans, copies of the plan and amendments thereto and the names of any loan originators covered by such plans, or determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding such plans. The Bureau is also clarifying the comment by removing the reference to certain agreements being \u201cpresumed\u201d to be a record of the amount of compensation actually paid to the loan originator. Instead, as revised, the comment provides that such agreements are a record of the amount actually paid to the loan originator unless actual compensation deviates from the amount in the disclosure or agreement.",
                                "The Bureau is further revising comment 25(c)(2)-1.i to indicate that if compensation has been decreased to defray the cost, in whole or part, of an unforeseen increase in an actual settlement cost over an estimated settlement cost disclosed to the consumer pursuant to section 5(c) of RESPA (or omitted from that disclosure), records to be maintained are those documenting the decrease in compensation and the reasons for it. This revision corresponds with changes to the commentary to \u00a7 1026.36(d)(1) clarifying that the section prohibits a loan originator from reducing its compensation to bear the cost of a change in transaction terms except to defray such unforeseen increases in settlement cost. Retaining these records will allow for agency examination about whether a particular decrease in loan originator compensation is truly based on unforeseen increases to settlement costs, i.e., whether it indicates a pattern or practice of the loan originator repeatedly decreasing loan originator compensation to defray the costs of pricing concessions for the same categories of settlement costs across multiple transactions. Like other records sufficient to evidence compensation paid to loan originators, the Bureau believes that records of decreases in loan originator compensation in unforeseen circumstances to defray the costs of increased settlement cost above those estimated should be retained for a time period commensurate with the statute of limitations for causes of action under TILA section 130 and be readily available for examination, which is necessary to prevent circumvention of and to facilitate compliance with TILA.",
                                "Proposed comment 25(c)(2)-1.ii would have clarified that the compensation agreement, evidence of which must be retained under 1026.25(c)(2), is any agreement, written or oral, or course of conduct that establishes a compensation arrangement between the parties. Proposed comment 25(c)(2)-1.iii provided an example where the expiration of the three-year retention period varies depending on when multiple payments of compensation are made. Proposed comment 25(c)(2)-2 provided an example of retention of records sufficient to evidence payment of compensation. The Bureau did not receive any public comment on these proposed comments. The Bureau is adopting comments 25(c)(2)-1.iii and 25(c)(2)-2 as proposed. Comment 25(c)(2)-1.ii is revised slightly from the proposal to clarify that where a compensation agreement is oral or based on a course of conduct and cannot itself be maintained, the records to be maintained are those, if any, evidencing the existence or terms of the oral or course of conduct compensation agreement."

Specifically, the proposed Closing Disclosure incorporated: (i) Three pages of the RESPA settlement statement; (ii) two pages typically used for the final TILA disclosure; (iii) one page for the negative amortization statement under TILA section 129C(f), which was added by section 1414(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act; (iv) one page for the anti-deficiency protection notice under TILA section 129C(g)(2), which was added by section 1414(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act; (v) one page for the partial payment policy disclosure under TILA section 129C(h), which was added by section 1414(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act; and (vi) one page for the escrow account disclosures under TILA sections 129D(h) and (j)(1)(A), which were added by sections 1461 and 1462 of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Closing Disclosure would have incorporated the disclosure of: (i) The total interest percentage under TILA section 128(a)(19), which was added by section 1419 of the Dodd-Frank Act; (ii) the approximate amount of the wholesale rate of funds in connection with the loan under TILA section 128(a)(17), which was added by section 1419 of the Dodd-Frank Act; and (iii) the aggregate amount of settlement charges for all settlement services provided in connection with the loan and the aggregate amount of other fees or required payments in connection with the loan under TILA section 128(a)(17), which was added by section 1419 of the Dodd-Frank Act. In absence of the Bureau's integration of the final TILA disclosure and the RESPA settlement statement, these disclosures would have been added to the final TILA disclosure, which potentially could have increased that disclosure's typical two pages to three pages.",

Specifically with respect to the design of the Closing Disclosure, the Bureau also received comments both criticizing and praising the proposed format. For example, a national title company commented that the proposed Closing Disclosure clearly addresses the most important questions consumers ask at the closing table and gives consumers an informative snapshot of their transaction. An independent title agent commented that the design of the proposed Closing Disclosure was easy to read. In contrast, a title insurance company commented that the Closing Disclosure is too long and overly complicated. Similarly, an individual title attorney commented that she saw no difference in the quality of information provided to consumers in the proposed Closing Disclosure as compared to the RESPA settlement statement and final TILA disclosure.",

As discussed more fully in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.37, the Bureau received many comments that expressed confusion over whether inapplicable disclosures could be eliminated. In response to those comments, the Bureau is revising \u00a7 1026.38 to delete the phrase \u201cas applicable.\u201d The Bureau is further revising comment 38-1 to clarify that disclosures not applicable may be left blank, but that \u201cN/A\u201d or \u201cnot applicable\u201d may not be used and form H-25 may not be modified.

The GSE argued that such a statement on the Closing Disclosure would allow consumers to confirm that the rate they received at closing was locked on the date stated on the Loan Estimate and would provide lenders and investors with important data for compliance purposes. The Bureau does not believe that such a disclosure would benefit consumers given that a consumer could easily review the Loan Estimate to recall the date on which the interest rate was locked.

Accordingly, the Bureau believed, as stated in the proposal, that this disclosure will benefit consumers and effectuate the purposes of TILA and RESPA by promoting the informed use of credit and more effective advance notice of settlement costs, consistent with TILA section 105(a) and RESPA section 19(a), and will ensure that the features of the transaction are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to better understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with mortgage transactions, in light of the facts and circumstances, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a).",

With respect to timeshares, final comment 19(e)(1)(iii)-4 permits creditors in timeshare transactions to omit provision of the Loan Estimate and provide only the Closing Disclosure where the transaction is consummated within three business days of receipt of the consumer's application. The Bureau does not believe that the disclosure required by \u00a7 1026.37(a)(2) should be modified because the timeshare creditors can adequately explain to consumers at consummation why they were not required to receive the Loan Estimate in those transactions. The Bureau believes the statement will be just as useful to consumers of transactions secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan where consummation occurs after the third business day from receipt of the consumer's application as it will be for consumers in transactions secured by real property.

The Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1026.38(a)(3)(vi) and comment 38(a)(3)(vi)-1 substantially as proposed but with modifications to clarify that, unlike with respect to the disclosure of personal property in connection with the Loan Estimate, personal property securing the transaction may be disclosed if it does not fit within the space provided on form H-25 by using an addendum to form H-25 for the Closing Disclosure. The Bureau believes that in connection with the consummation of the transaction, the consumer should be provided with this information to understand the final loan terms and costs of the transaction."

A GSE commented that the value that should be disclosed is the one used for underwriting, regardless of whether there is a subsequent appraisal. The GSE commenter noted that other fees disclosed on the Closing Disclosure, such as mortgage insurance and loan level pricing adjustments, are tied to the loan-to-value ratio which is, in turn, determined by the value used for underwriting. The commenter stated that disclosing a value different than the one used for underwriting would render the disclosures on the Closing Disclosure misaligned and cause confusion for consumers and creditors.

Accordingly, the Bureau is further revising comment 38(a)(3)(vii)-1 to revise the description of the requirement to disclose the most recent appraisal or valuation and clarify that \u00a7 1026.38(a)(3)(vii) requires disclosure of the appraisal or estimate used to determine approval of the credit transaction. Regarding the GSE's request for guidance on the disclosure of personal property, the Bureau addresses that comment in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.37(a)(7), above.

The proposal noted the Bureau's belief, based on consumer testing, that this additional reference would help consumers to understand the specific payment amounts to be made with escrow funds and those that must be paid separately by the consumer. Second, proposed \u00a7 1026.38(c) would have provided different rules for estimating escrow payments. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of proposed \u00a7 1026.37(c), the Dodd-Frank Act amended TILA to add new requirements regarding the disclosure of escrow payments in consumer credit transactions secured by a first mortgage on the principal dwelling of the consumer, other than an open-end credit plan or reverse mortgage. Specifically, TILA section 128(b)(4)(A) provides that the disclosures required by TILA section 128(a)(6) must take into account the amount of any monthly payment to an escrow account, in accordance with section 10(a)(2) of RESPA. 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(4)(A); 12 U.S.C. 2609(a)(2). In addition, new TILA section 128(b)(4)(B) generally requires creditors to take into account the taxable assessed value of the property during the first year after consummation, including the value of any improvements constructed or to be constructed on the property, if known, and the replacement costs of the property for hazard or flood insurance, when disclosing estimated escrow payments pursuant to TILA section 128(b)(4)(A). 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(4)(B). For the Loan Estimate provided to consumers near the time of application, proposed \u00a7 1026.37(c) generally would have incorporated these statutory provisions, but would have expanded the requirements to all transactions subject to \u00a7 1026.37(c). However, the proposal noted the Bureau's belief that separate treatment is required for the Closing Disclosure because the statutory requirements may conflict with certain provisions of Regulation X, which implements the provisions of RESPA sections 6(g) and 10, regarding the administration of escrow accounts. 12 U.S.C. 2605(g), 2609.",

If the charge is unknown, the creditor may base the estimate on the preceding year's charge, but may adjust the estimate to account for inflation. The Regulation X requirement that the creditor use actual charges, if known, in estimating escrow payment amounts may conflict with the TILA section 128(b)(4)(B) requirement that the creditor take into account the replacement costs of the property for hazard insurance when determining the estimated escrow amount. Under the plain language of TILA section 128(b)(4)(B), a creditor must base estimated escrows for hazard insurance on the replacement costs of the property, even if it knows that the actual charges will be different. The proposal noted that while the Bureau believes that the TILA requirement for estimating escrow payments is appropriate for the Loan Estimate because it requires creditors to use a uniform standard for estimates and therefore facilitates comparison, the disclosure of actual payment amounts, when known, is more appropriate for the Closing Disclosure.",
                        "Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to use its authority under TILA section 105(a), Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a), and, for residential mortgage loans, Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(b) to modify the requirements of TILA section 128(b)(4)(B) for the estimation of escrow payment amounts on the Closing Disclosure. Proposed \u00a7 1026.38(c) would have provided that, in disclosing estimated escrow payments as described in \u00a7 1026.37(c)(2)(iii) and (4)(ii), the amount disclosed on the Closing Disclosure: (1) for transactions subject to RESPA, is determined under the escrow account analysis described in Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.17, and (2) for transactions not subject to RESPA, may be determined under the escrow account analysis described in Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.17, or in the manner set forth in \u00a7 1026.37(c)(5). Comment 38(c)(1)-1 would have clarified that the amount of estimated escrow payments disclosed on the Closing Disclosure is accurate if it differs from the estimated escrow payment disclosed on the Loan Estimate due to the escrow account analysis described in Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.17. The Bureau noted its belief that the proposed modification would effectuate the purposes of TILA by promoting the informed use of credit by allowing disclosure of actual escrow amounts for hazard insurance, when known. Additionally, the Bureau noted its belief that the proposed modification would ease compliance burden for creditors. In particular, permitting creditors in transactions not subject to RESPA to rely on the accounting rules described in Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.17, to calculate the escrow payment disclosure would avoid requiring creditors to follow a separate disclosure requirement for the relatively small number of transactions that are subject to TILA but not RESPA. The Bureau also noted that the proposed modification will also improve consumer awareness and understanding of residential mortgage loans and is in the interest of consumers and the public, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(b). The Bureau also noted its belief that the disclosure would ensure that the features of consumer credit transactions secured by real property are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the product or service, in light of the facts and circumstances, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a).",
                        "The Bureau received a number of comments on the projected payments table from industry and consumer advocacy groups. Those comments are generally discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.37(c). The Bureau has considered those comments and made certain adjustments to the rules regarding the projected payments table in response to those comments and for additional clarity, as discussed above. Because the requirements of proposed \u00a7 1026.38(c) generally would have mirrored those of proposed \u00a7 1026.37(c), with certain exceptions outlined above, the comments received regarding the projected payments table are generally applicable to the projected payments table under \u00a7 1026.38(c). In addition, one industry trade association commenter argued that, unlike the Loan Estimate where estimated escrow payments should always be disclosed, loans with no escrow account do not need escrow information on a Closing Disclosure.",
                        "For the reasons discussed in the proposed rule, in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.37(c), and below, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1026.38(c) as proposed, although the changes to the projected payments table described above in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.37(c) also apply \u00a7 1026.38(c). The Bureau has considered the comment suggesting that loans with no escrow account do not need escrow information disclosed on the Closing Disclosure. However, as noted above in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.37(c) and in the Kleimann Testing Report, consumer testing indicates that consumers view their total monthly payment as a key piece of information and that, even where no escrow account is established for the payment of taxes and insurance, the Bureau believes that information about such costs is an important measure of the consumer's ability to afford the transaction. See Kleimann Testing Report at 285. Absent such a disclosure, consumers may not fully comprehend the cost of their home loan on a periodic basis, and may not be as readily able to make an informed decision about whether to proceed with the transaction. Accordingly, the final rule requires creditors to disclose consumer's taxes, insurance, and assessment information on the table required by \u00a7 1026.38(c), even where no escrow account for the payment of such amounts will be established."

These commenters stated that consumers would have difficulty in understanding negative numbers in this context. The Bureau, in response to these comments, conducted additional qualitative testing of the proposed integrated disclosures using a sample refinance transaction in which a consumer would receive cash at consummation, in which case the cash to close would be disclosed as a negative amount, and a modified version of the integrated disclosures with an alternative table that would use checkboxes to denote that cash was received at consummation. As described in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.37(d) above, based on the comments received and this qualitative testing, the Bureau believes that disclosing a positive cash to close amount with a checkbox to denote that cash will be received will be more understandable to consumers than disclosing a negative amount for the cash to close. In addition, as also described in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.37(d) above, in response to comments received regarding the proposed cash to close tables under \u00a7\u00a7 1026.37(d) and 1026.38(d) and the results of one question in the Bureau's Quantitative Study regarding the total closing costs amount, the Bureau tested with consumers a revised cash to close table on page 1 of the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure to place equal emphasis on the total closing costs amount and the cash to close amount for consumers, rather than placing the total closing costs amount embedded in text to the right of the cash to close amount as it was in the proposed Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure. See Kleimann Post-Proposal Testing Report at 51-52, 58, 62, 71; Kleimann Quantitative Study at 74. This table included a revised heading, \u201cCosts at Closing.\u201d Based on the comments received and its consumer testing, the Bureau believes this modification to the cash to close table enhances consumer understanding of the transaction.",

In addition, \u00a7 1026.38(d) as revised provides for an alternative cash to close disclosure for transactions without a seller, consistent with the provisions of \u00a7 1026.37(d) and (h) and \u00a7 1026.38(e). As a result of these revisions, the cash to close disclosure under proposed \u00a7 1026.38(d), is adopted in \u00a7 1026.38(d)(1), which will use cross-references from the provisions of \u00a7 1026.38(f), (g), and (h) for the amounts to be disclosed. The alternative cash to close disclosure under \u00a7 1026.38(d)(2) must be provided for transactions without a seller when the Loan Estimate is disclosed with the optional alternative table pursuant to \u00a7 1026.37(d)(2). The alternative cash to close disclosure under \u00a7 1026.38(d)(2) will use cross-references from the provisions of \u00a7 1026.38(e) for the amounts to be disclosed. The Bureau also is adopting comments 38(d)(2)-1, which clarifies that the use of the alternative cash to close disclosure under \u00a7 1026.38(d)(2) must be used when the alternative calculating cash to close table under \u00a7 1026.38(e) is used; and 38(d)(2)-2, which provides an example of how the indication of whether the cash is due from or to the consumer can be disclosed with the use of checkboxes, as shown in form H-25(J) of appendix H.",

This disclosure will promote the informed use of credit and consumer understanding of the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the loan because it will indicate to the consumer the amount the consumer will pay at consummation of the credit transaction and closing of the real estate transaction."

The Bureau developed and conducted qualitative consumer testing of an alternative Calculating Cash to Close table after reviewing these comments. The Bureau's consumer testing of the alternative table demonstrated greater consumer comprehension and the alternative table proved to be readily understood by consumers for transactions without a seller. See Kleimann Post-Proposal Testing Report at 58, 71.",
                        "Accordingly, the Bureau adopts \u00a7 1026.38(e) to require an alternative calculating cash to close table for transactions without a seller when the Loan Estimate was disclosed with the optional alternative Calculating Cash to Close table permitted under \u00a7 1026.37(h)(2). The Bureau is requiring use of the alternative Calculating Cash to Close table permitted under \u00a7 1026.38(e) if the optional alternative table under \u00a7 1026.37(h)(2) is used because the Bureau designed the tables to match information and content. The Bureau has designed the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure generally to match, to enable easier comparison of estimated and final numbers for consumers. The Bureau's Quantitative Study determined that consumer participants using the Bureau's integrated disclosures performed statistically significantly better than consumer participants using the current disclosures at comparing estimated and final loan terms costs. See Kleimann Quantitative Study Report at 68. The Bureau believes this increased performance is due, in part, to the matching designs of the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure. Accordingly, the Bureau has determined to require the alternative Calculating Cash to Close table permitted under \u00a7 1026.38(e) if the optional alternative table under \u00a7 1026.37(h)(2) is used, because use of a similar format and content for the table on both the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure will enable consumers to compare changes more easily between the estimated and final terms and costs, aiding consumer understanding of the transaction, which is one of the purposes of the integrated disclosures under Dodd-Frank Act sections 1098 and 1100A.",

The disclosure of the closing costs financed, because it is not part of the calculation of the cash to close in the alternative table, is not disclosed as a row in the table, but instead, disclosed in the bottom right of the table. The calculation of the closing costs financed amount in the alternative table under \u00a7 1026.38(e) is the same as under \u00a7 1026.38(h)(2)(v), except that the sum of closing costs designated borrower-paid before closing under \u00a7 1026.38(h)(2) are subtracted from the amount, because those costs are not paid from loan funds. The consumer has made payment for those charges before the loan was consummated. The Bureau is adopting comment 38(e)-1 to clarify that the optional use of the alternative table must be made in conjunction with the alternative disclosure under \u00a7 1026.38(d)(2). Based on its authority under TILA section 105(a), RESPA section 19(a), and Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a), the Bureau is requiring the creditor in a transaction without a seller to provide an alternative Calculating Cash to Close table in lieu of disclosing the table required by \u00a7 1026.38(i) when the alternative Calculating Cash to Close table was disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.37(h)(2) which highlights the cash to close amount and its critical components and compares those amounts to the corresponding disclosures shown on the Loan Estimate under \u00a7 1026.37(h). The Bureau believes that this disclosure will effectuate the purposes of TILA and RESPA by facilitating the informed use of credit and ensuring that consumers are provided with greater and timelier information on the costs of the closing process. Providing consumers with information about the cash to close amount, its critical components, and how such amounts changed from the estimated amounts disclosed on the Loan Estimate helps ensure that the features of the transaction are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to better understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the transaction, in light of the facts and circumstances, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a)."

The Bureau was authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act to define the term \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d and has done so in its 2013 ATR Final Rule. However, the 2013 ATR Final Rule does not define the types of reverse mortgage loans that should be considered \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d because, by statute, TILA's ability-to-repay rules do not apply to reverse mortgages. See TILA section 129C(a)(8), 15 U.S.C. 1639c(a)(8). Thus the Agencies are not able to implement the precise statutory exemption for &#8220;reverse mortgage loans that are qualified mortgages.&#8221; Instead, the exemption for reverse mortgages is based on the Agencies' express authority to exempt from TILA's &#8220;higher-risk mortgage&#8221; appraisal rules &#8220;a class of loans,&#8221; if the exemption &#8220;is in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors.&#8221; TILA section 129H(b)(4)(B), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(4)(B).",

As noted, high-cost mortgages will be subject to these restrictions in addition to the requirements imposed in this final rule. With respect to prepayment penalty revisions, the Dodd-Frank Act deleted the statutory restrictions applicable to high-cost mortgages. The new Dodd-Frank Act prepayment penalty restrictions of section 1414 are implemented as discussed below.",
        "147":"The points and fees limit for qualified mortgages set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, as implemented in \u00a7 1026.43(e) of this final rule (including separate points and fees limits for smaller loans), is lower than the high-cost mortgage points and fees threshold. Thus, any loan that triggers the high-cost mortgage provisions through the points and fees criteria could not satisfy the qualified mortgage definition. Likewise, \u00a7 1026.43(g) of this final rule provides that, where qualified mortgages are permitted to have prepayment penalties, such penalties may not be imposed more than three years after consummation or in an amount that exceeds 2 percent of the amount prepaid. This limitation aligns with the prepayment penalty trigger for the high-cost mortgage provisions, such that a loan that satisfies the qualified mortgage requirements would never trigger the high-cost mortgage provisions as a result of a prepayment penalty.",
