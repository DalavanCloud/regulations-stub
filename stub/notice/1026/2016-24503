                "Existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(b) provides examples of the types of charges that are finance charges, except if those charges are specifically excluded under existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(c) through (e). In particular, existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(2) provides that examples of finance charges generally include service, transaction, activity, and carrying charges. However, the Board added a partial exception to this example stating that any charge imposed on a checking or other transaction account, such a service or transaction account charge, is only a finance charge to the extent that the charge exceeds the charge for a similar account without a credit feature. Existing comment 4(b)(2)-1 similarly provides that a checking or transaction account charge imposed in connection with a credit feature is a finance charge under existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(2) to the extent the charge exceeds the charge for a similar account without a credit feature. If a charge for a checking or transaction account with a credit feature does not exceed the charge for an account without a credit feature, the charge is not a finance charge under existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(2). For purposes of existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(2), a per transaction fee imposed on a checking account with a credit feature (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> overdraft line of credit where the financial institution has agreed in writing to pay an overdraft) can be compared with a fee imposed for paying or returning each item on a similar account without a credit feature. Thus, if a per transaction fee imposed on a checking account with a credit feature for accessing credit does not exceed the fee for paying an overdraft or NSF fee on the checking account with no credit feature, the per transaction fee imposed on the checking account with the credit feature is not a finance charge under existing \u00a7 1026.4(b)(2).",
                "The proposal would have set forth a different rule for when fees imposed on prepaid accounts would have been finance charges than the standard set forth in existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(2). Specifically, proposed \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(2)(ii) would have provided that any charge imposed in connection with an extension of credit, for carrying a credit balance, or for credit availability would have been a finance charge where that fee is imposed on a prepaid account in connection with credit accessed by a prepaid card, regardless of whether the creditor imposes the same, greater, or lesser charge on the withdrawal of funds from the prepaid account, to have access to the prepaid account, or when credit is not extended. Proposed comment 4(b)(2)-1.ii through iv, would have clarified the rule set forth in proposed \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(2)(ii).

Separately, as part of this final rule, the Bureau is adopting similar provisions for prepaid accounts in final Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.19. Although the Bureau is not revising \u00a7\u20091026.58, it notes that the requirements of \u00a7\u20091026.58 and those of Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.19 are distinct and independent of one another. In other words, issuers must comply with both as appropriate. The Bureau notes, however, that it does not believe it is likely that any agreement will constitute both a credit card agreement and a prepaid account agreement and thus be required to be submitted under both \u00a7\u20091026.58 and Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.19. Given the requirement in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b) that credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards generally must be structured as separate subaccounts or accounts distinct from the prepaid asset account, in conjunction with the account-opening disclosure requirements in existing \u00a7\u20091026.6 and the initial disclosure requirements in existing Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.7(b) as well as final \u00a7\u20091005.18(f)(1), the Bureau believes it is unlikely that an issuer would use a single agreement to provide all such disclosures for both a prepaid account and for a covered separate credit feature.",

As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(b) below, a negative balance feature accessible by a prepaid card triggers application of the credit card rules under the final rule for purposes of coverage except as provided in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). However, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b) requires that an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in connection with a prepaid account (except as provided in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)) must be structured as a separate subaccount or account, distinct from the prepaid asset account, in order to facilitate transparency and compliance with various elements of Regulation Z. Such a separate credit feature is defined as a \u201ccovered separate credit feature\u201d under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i). Accordingly, the Bureau is revising new comment 20(a)(2)-2.ii from the proposal to discuss a situation where a hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses a \u201ccovered separate credit feature\u201d under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i) rather than credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account that would violate new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b).",

Such a program constitutes a plan notwithstanding that, for example, the creditor has not agreed in writing to extend credit for those transactions, the creditor retains discretion not to extend credit for those transactions, or the creditor does not extend credit for those transactions once the consumer has exceeded a certain amount of credit. The comment also cross-references new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a) and related commentary for guidance on the applicability of this regulation to credit accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.",
                        "With respect to the programs described above, the Bureau believes these programs are plans notwithstanding that, for example, the person offering the program reserves the right not to extend credit on individual transactions. The Bureau believes that the person's reservation of such discretion in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards does not connote the absence of an open-end credit plan. If consumers using covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards must agree to repay the debt created by an overdraft or advance, a contractual arrangement between the creditor and the consumer exists. The Bureau notes that credit card issuers similarly reserve the right to reject individual transactions, and thus the Bureau believes that automated overdraft services are comparable."

In contrast, if the Bureau were to interpret narrowly the criterion of open-end credit that a finance charge may be imposed time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance and include only finance charges resulting from periodic rates, covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are charge card accounts instead would constitute closed-end credit. Under existing \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(17)(iv), a card issuer offering such a charge card account would be a \u201ccreditor\u201d for purposes of, and would need to comply with, the closed-end disclosure provisions in subpart C as well as certain open-end (not home-secured) disclosures rules in subpart B.",
                        "The Bureau believes that receiving closed-end disclosures for these types of accounts would be confusing to consumers because the disclosures would be different from those disclosures received in connection with other open-end credit card accounts. Where the transactions otherwise would appear to be part of an open-end plan based on repeated transactions and replenishing credit, the Bureau believes that consumers would be better protected and better informed if such transactions were treated as open-end plans in the same way as their other credit card accounts. In addition, with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card where that credit feature is a charge card account, the Bureau believes that complying with the closed-end credit rules would be difficult for card issuers (for example, at point of sale) because closed-end disclosures specific to each credit extension would need to be provided prior to each transaction. Thus, the Bureau is retaining the current interpretation in existing comment 2(a)(20)-4 that a finance charge is considered to be imposed from time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance, as described in existing \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(20), if there is no specific amount financed for the credit feature for which the finance charge, total of payments, and payment schedule can be calculated. This means that most covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards will meet the definition of \u201copen-end credit\u201d if any finance charge may be imposed on the covered separate credit feature or asset feature of the prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.",
                        "The Bureau also notes that persons that offer covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards where no finance charge may be imposed on the covered separate credit feature or asset feature of the prepaid account that are both accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card still would be subject to certain Regulation Z provisions. See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(17) above."

                "The Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its adjustment authority under TILA section 105(a) to effectuate the purposes of TILA by applying section 140(f)'s requirements for college card agreements to prepaid cards where covered separate credit features that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may subsequently be added. The provisions in TILA section 140(f) addressing college card agreements reflect Congress's particular concern with providing special protections for students to ensure that students can make informed credit decisions, and the Bureau believes that including such cards is consistent with such congressional concerns for college students and credit card debt. The Bureau believes that the marketing efforts related to a prepaid account, including the inducements given by a card issuer to open a prepaid account, may have an impact on whether consumers may request that a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit card be linked to the prepaid account, as discussed above, when such covered separate credit features are offered to them.

Under new \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1, with respect to a non-covered separate credit feature as defined in new \u00a7\u20091026.61, none of the fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are \u201ccharges imposed as part of the plan\u201d under final \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3) with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. New comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1 also cross-references new comment 4(b)(11)-1.ii.B, which provides that none of the fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are finance charges under final \u00a7\u20091026.4 with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. Thus, final \u00a7\u20091026.52(b) does not apply to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.4 and 1026.6 above, the Bureau believes that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account are more appropriately regulated under Regulation E, rather than regulated under Regulation Z, with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature."

The Bureau solicited comment on: (1) How credit card issuers anticipate handling this situation, including cases where the prepaid account contains funds sufficient to pay some, but not all, of the credit card payment due; (2) whether issuers anticipate charging a specific fee because the preauthorized payment could not be completed, in addition to any late fee that might be charged if the credit card balance was not paid by the due date; and (3) whether the Bureau should adopt any specific rules to address these issues, and if so, what rules should the Bureau adopt.",
                        "The proposal included this request for comment in the discussion of the offset prohibition in proposed \u00a7\u20091026.12(d). With respect to credit card accounts accessed by prepaid cards that would have been credit cards under the proposal, proposed \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(3) would have allowed an exception for certain preauthorized payment plans to the offset prohibition in proposed \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(1). In response to this request for comment, several consumer group commenters indicated that the Bureau should adopt additional restrictions in \u00a7\u20091026.52(b) related to the circumstances in which card issuers can charge fees when preauthorized payments are returned unpaid and/or related to the amount of the fees. One consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should adopt rules to cover the situation where the consumer authorizes periodic deductions, but there is not enough money to cover a payment when due. In particular, this commenter indicated the Bureau should prohibit fees that are imposed by card issuers when preauthorized payments are returned unpaid under existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) as a \u201cdeclined transaction fee.\u201d Existing \u00a7 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B) provides that a card issuer must not impose a fee for violating the terms or other requirements of a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan when there is no dollar amount associated with the violation. Existing \u00a7 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) provides that there is no dollar amount associated with transactions that the card issuer declines to authorize, and thus fees charged for those declined transactions are prohibited under existing \u00a7 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B).",
                        "In the alternative, this commenter indicated that the Bureau should use its authority to establish \u201cadditional requirements\u201d to provide for a \u201cright to cure\u201d period for the limited circumstance of prepaid consumers who have authorized automatic deductions to repay credit associated with their prepaid card. This commenter indicated that the Bureau should require the card issuer to provide a limited time period, such as one week, to add funds to the prepaid account before a penalty fee under \u00a7\u20091026.52(b) could be imposed. In that case, any penalty fees would be subject to the limitations of existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(b), namely, that the fee amount (1) must be consistent with either the cost analysis in existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(b)(1)(i) or the safe harbors in existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(b)(1)(ii); and (2) does not exceed the dollar amount associated with the violation under existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(b)(2)(i). In addition, under existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(b)(2)(ii), a card issuer could not impose more than one fee for violating the terms or other requirements of a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan based on a single event or transaction.",
                        "Another consumer group commenter indicated that if the prepaid account does not have enough funds to satisfy a requested transfer or a preauthorized payment, the Bureau should provide some kind of cushion where consumers could avoid a fee if the debt obligation falls below a certain threshold\u2014 <em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> less than $20 and that no fee should be greater than the minimum 4 percent repayment amount and/or the overdraft service charge.",
                        "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(3) above, with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, as defined in \u00a7\u20091026.61, final \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(3) sets forth an exception for certain preauthorized payment plans with respect to the offset prohibition in final \u00a7\u20091026.12(d). The Bureau does not believe that fees imposed by card issuers when preauthorized payments are returned unpaid are fees for declined transactions under \u00a7\u20091026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>). The Bureau believes that it is clear under existing comment 52(b)-1.i.B that fees imposed by card issuers when preauthorized payments are returned unpaid constitute fees for returned payments and are regulated as returned payment fees under \u00a7 1026.52(b)(1), (2)(i)(A), and (2)(ii). Specifically, existing comment 52(b)(1)-i.B provides that the limitations in \u00a7 1026.52(b) apply to returned payment fees and any other fees imposed by a card issuer if a payment initiated via check, ACH, or other payment method is returned. Existing commentary to \u00a7 1026.52(b)(1), (2)(i)(A), and (2)(ii) provide guidance on how the restrictions in existing \u00a7 1026.52(b)(1), (2)(i)(A) and (2)(ii) apply to returned payment fees. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See, e.g.,</em> comments 52(b)(1)(i)-7, 52(b)(1)(ii)-1.i.B, 52(b)(1)(ii)-1.iii.C, 52(b)(2)(i)-2, and 52(b)(2)(ii)-1.ii, iii and v through vii. For example, \u00a7 1026.52(b)(1), and (b)(2)(i)(A) and related commentary restrict the amount of the fee that a card issuer can impose for a returned payment. In addition, if a payment has been returned and is submitted again for payment by the card issuer, comment 52(b)(2)(i)-2 provides that there is no additional dollar amount associated with a subsequent return of that payment and a card issuer is prohibited from imposing an additional returned payment fee. Also, comment 52(b)(2)(ii)-1.ii.A and B provide that a card issuer is prohibited from assessing both a late payment fee and a returned payment fee based on a single event or transaction. The existing restrictions in \u00a7 1026.52(b)(1), (2)(i)(A), and (2)(ii), and related commentary regarding returned payment fees apply to fees imposed by card issuers when preauthorized payments are returned unpaid in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, as defined in \u00a7 1026.61, that are subject to \u00a7 1026.52(b).",
                        "The Bureau has not established additional requirements beyond those contained in \u00a7\u20091026.52(b)(1), (2)(i)(A), and (2)(ii) and related commentary regarding returned payment fees in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, such as a right to cure period for prepaid consumers where preauthorized payments have been returned unpaid. At this time, the Bureau believes that the fee restrictions that apply generally to credit card accounts in existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(b)(1), (2)(i)(A), and (2)(ii) and related commentary with respect to returned payments are sufficient to protect consumers with respect to the circumstances in which card issuer can impose fees for preauthorized payments that are returned unpaid in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. The Bureau will continue to monitor whether additional safeguards are needed."

Specifically, proposed \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(2)(ii) would have provided that any charge imposed on the prepaid account in connection with an extension of credit, for carrying a credit balance, or for credit availability would have been a finance charge where that fee is imposed on a prepaid account in connection with credit accessed by a prepaid card, regardless of whether the creditor imposes the same, greater, or lesser charge on the withdrawal of funds from the prepaid account, to have access to the prepaid account, or when credit is not extended.",
                        "Under proposed comment 4(b)(2)-1.ii, transaction fees imposed on a prepaid account for credit extensions would have been finance charges, regardless of whether the creditor imposes the same, greater, or lesser per transaction fee to withdraw funds from the prepaid account. To illustrate, assume a $1.50 transaction charge is imposed on the prepaid account for each transaction that is made with the prepaid card, including when the prepaid card is used to access credit where the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the prepaid account at the time of authorization or at the time the transaction is paid. Under the proposal, the $1.50 transaction charge would have been a finance charge when the prepaid card accesses credit, notwithstanding that a $1.50 transaction charge also is imposed on transactions that solely access funds in the prepaid account.",

For example, assume a creditor imposes $5 monthly service charge on the prepaid account for the availability of an open-end plan that is accessed by a prepaid card. Under the proposal, the $5 monthly service charge would have been a finance charge regardless of whether the creditor imposes the same, greater, or lesser monthly service charge to hold the prepaid account.",

For example, if a cash-reload fee were imposed on the prepaid account and an additional charge were imposed on the prepaid account for a credit extension because there were not sufficient funds in the prepaid account to pay the cash reload fee when it was imposed on the prepaid account, the additional charge would have been a transaction charge imposed on a prepaid account in connection with an extension of credit and would have been a finance charge under proposed \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(2)(ii).",

                        "Many industry commenters raised concerns regarding the breadth of fees that would be considered finance charges under the proposal. Many industry commenters were concerned that even though they did not intend to offer credit in connection with the prepaid account, credit could result in certain circumstances, such as forced pay-transactions as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61 below. Because this credit could be extended, many commenters were concerned that fees that generally applied to the prepaid account, but were not specific to the overdraft credit, could be finance charges under the proposal and thus would subject the prepaid account issuer to the credit card rules under Regulation Z. These commenters were concerned that they could not charge certain fees on the prepaid account, or would have to waive certain fees, for the prepaid card not to be considered to be a credit card under the proposal. In particular, proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F would have provided that the term \u201ccredit card\u201d includes a prepaid card (including a prepaid card that is solely an account number) that is a single device that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan, except for when the prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in \u00a7\u20091026.4, or any fee described in \u00a7\u20091026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Under the proposal, for a prepaid card not to be a credit card when it accesses a credit plan, the credit accessed by the prepaid card could not be subject to any finance charge, as defined in \u00a7\u20091026.4, or any fee described in \u00a7\u20091026.4(c), and any credit accessed could not be payable by written agreement in more than four installments.",
                        "Many industry commenters indicated that certain fees should not be considered finance charges in connection with credit accessed by a prepaid card, and thus, a prepaid account issuer could continue to charge these fees on the prepaid account without the prepaid card becoming a credit card under the proposal.",
                        "For example, several commenters, including an industry trade association, an issuing bank, a program manager, and a digital wallet provider, indicated that consistent with existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(2), a fee that is imposed on a prepaid account in both credit and cash transactions should not be a finance charge when the fee is imposed on a prepaid account. They argued that these fees are exempt from the definition of finance charge under the \u201ccomparable cash transaction\u201d exception. Existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(2) provides that examples of finance charges generally include service, transaction, activity, and carrying charges. However, existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(2) contains a partial exception to this example stating that for any charge imposed on a checking or other transaction account, such a service or transaction account charge, is only a finance charge to the extent that the charge exceeds the charge for a similar account without a credit feature.",
                        "In addition, several commenters, including an industry trade association, an issuing bank, a program manager, and a digital wallet provider, indicated that the term \u201cfinance charge\u201d should not include per transaction fees charged on a prepaid account for an extension of credit that are the same amount as the fee that would be charged for transactions paid entirely with funds available in the prepaid account. These industry commenters were concerned that a prepaid account issuer would need to waive per transaction fees charged for credit extensions even if they were the same amount as the fee charged for transactions it paid entirely with funds available in the prepaid account to avoid charging a finance charge under the proposal. As discussed above, under the proposal, all per transaction fees for credit transactions were finance charges. Thus, under the proposal, a prepaid account issuer would need to waive per transaction fees imposed on the prepaid account for credit transactions for the prepaid card not to be a credit card under the proposal.",
                        "Two industry trade associations indicated that the term \u201cfinance charge\u201d should only include fees or charges arising from the fact that the transaction is an overdraft and specifically exclude other fees or charges that are wholly unrelated to the fact that the transaction is an overdraft, such as a fee for a balance inquiry at an ATM. These two commenters argued that such unrelated fees or charges should not be \u201cfinance charges\u201d even if they are imposed when the prepaid account balance is negative. Another industry trade association indicated that a monthly fee to hold the prepaid account should not be a \u201cfinance charge\u201d simply because it may be imposed when the balance on the prepaid account is negative or because negative balances can occur on the prepaid account.",
                        "Several consumer groups commented on this aspect of the proposal. One consumer group commenter indicated that per transaction fees for credit extensions imposed on prepaid accounts should be finance charges even if they are the same amount as the fee charged for transactions paid entirely with funds available in the prepaid account. This consumer group commenter indicated that if a prepaid account issuer wanted to avoid charging a finance charge on the prepaid account, the cleanest solution is the one the Bureau proposed: Simply waive the fee. Another consumer group commenter indicated that any fee or charge that occurs when credit is accessed should be considered a finance charge."

First, the Bureau provides guidance on the definition of finance charge in relation to covered separate credit features accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit cards. Second, the Bureau also provides guidance on the definition of finance charge in relation to credit features accessible by prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards. Starting with the first category, as described above, the Bureau generally intends the final rule to regulate prepaid cards as credit cards when they can access overdraft credit features offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or its business partners (except as provided in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)). Such credit features are generally required under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b) to be structured as a separate subaccount or account, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with Regulation Z. To effectuate this decision and provide compliance guidance to industry, new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11) and its related commentary specify rules for distinguishing when particular types of fees or charges that are imposed on the covered separate credit feature or on the asset feature on a prepaid account, which are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, are finance charges under Regulation Z. Specifically, new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11) provides that the following fees generally are finance charges with respect to such covered separate credit features and asset features: (1) Any fee or charge, such as interest rates and service, transaction, activity, or carrying charges, imposed on the covered separate credit feature, regardless of whether the credit feature is structured as a credit subaccount of the prepaid account or a separate credit account; and (2) any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. These provisions are discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(i) and (ii).",

As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61 below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a \u201cnon-covered separate credit feature,\u201d which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Second, under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61 or a credit card under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.",

This would not include fees or charges to open, issue, or hold the prepaid account where the amount of the fee or charge imposed on the asset feature is not higher based on whether credit might be offered or has been accepted, whether or how much credit the consumer has accessed, or the amount of credit available; (2) any fees or charges that will be imposed only when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature, except that a prepaid account issuer may impose fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law; or (3) any fees or charges where the amount of the fee or charge is higher when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature.",

New \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)(ii)(C) also makes clear that a prepaid account issuer may still satisfy the exception in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) even if it debits fees or charges from the asset feature when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature to cover those fees or charges at the time they are imposed, so long as those fees or charges are not the type of fees or charges enumerated in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) as discussed above.",

Provided it meets this limitation and the other requirements of new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), the prepaid account issuer will not be a \u201ccard issuer\u201d under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(7) and thus the credit card rules in Regulation Z do not apply to such a credit feature.",

As discussed above, many industry commenters were concerned that even though they did not intend to offer credit in connection with the prepaid account, credit could result in certain circumstances, such as force pay transactions as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61 below. Because this credit could be extended, many commenters were concerned that fees that generally applied to the prepaid account, but were not specific to the overdraft credit, could be finance charges under the proposal and thus would subject the prepaid account issuer to the credit card rules under Regulation Z. Because of these concerns, many industry commenters urged that that the Bureau not consider certain fees to be finance charges, and thus, a prepaid account issuer could continue to charge these fees on the prepaid account without making the prepaid card also a credit card under the proposal.",
                        "For example, several commenters, including an industry trade association, an issuing bank, a program manager, and a digital wallet provider, indicated that the term \u201cfinance charge\u201d should not include per transaction fees charged on a prepaid account for an extension of credit that are the same amount as the fee that would be charged for transactions paid entirely with funds available in the prepaid account. These industry commenters also were concerned that if they generally charged the same per transaction fee for all transactions paid using a prepaid account, regardless of whether the transaction is paid entirely with funds available in the prepaid account or is paid in whole or in part with credit, a prepaid account issuer would need to waive those per transaction fees for transactions resulting in an overdraft for a prepaid card not to be a credit card under the proposal. Also, two industry trade associations indicated that the term \u201cfinance charge\u201d should only include fees or charges arising from the fact that the transaction is an overdraft and specifically exclude other fees or charges that are wholly unrelated to the fact that the transaction is an overdraft, such as a fee for a balance inquiry at an ATM. These two commenters argued that such unrelated fees or charges should not be \u201cfinance charges\u201d even if they are imposed when the prepaid account balance is negative. Another industry trade association indicated that a monthly fee to hold the prepaid account should not be a \u201cfinance charge\u201d simply because it may be imposed when the balance on the prepaid account is negative or because negative balances can occur on the prepaid account.",
                        "The final rule addresses these concerns in a number of ways, so long as the types of credit provided are limited to the narrow types addressed in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). First, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) does not require a prepaid account issuer to waive per transaction fees imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account if the amount of the per transaction fee imposed for transactions involving credit is not higher than the amount of the fee that is imposed for transactions that only access funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account. Second, under the exception in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), the final rule provides that if a fee is not a fee enumerated in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B), the prepaid account issuer may still debit these fees or charges from the asset feature when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature to cover those fees or charges at the time they are imposed. Third, the final rule clarifies that under this exception, a prepaid account issuer may charge a fee to hold the prepaid account, so long as the amount of the fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is not higher based on whether credit might be offered or has been accepted, whether or how much credit the consumer has accessed, or the amount of credit available.",

First, the covered separate credit feature could be structured such that a consumer can use a hybrid prepaid-credit card to make a purchase to obtain goods or services from a merchant, and credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature without transferring funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase. For example, assume that the consumer has $10 of funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and initiates a transaction with a merchant to obtain goods or services with the hybrid prepaid-credit card for $25. In this case, $10 is debited from the asset feature, and $15 of credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature accessed by the hybrid prepaid-credit card without any transfer of funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase.",

                        "New \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(5)(i) and (iii) and their related commentary define \u201caffiliate\u201d and \u201cbusiness partner\u201d respectively. Under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(5)(i), an affiliate is any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another company, as set forth in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841 <em data-original=\"E-03\">et seq.</em>). Under new \u00a7 1026.61(a)(5)(iii), a business partner is a person (other than the prepaid account issuer or its affiliates) that can extend credit through a separate credit feature, where the person or its affiliate has an \u201carrangement\u201d with a prepaid account issuer or its affiliate. New comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1 describes two types of \u201carrangements\u201d that would make such a person that can extend credit a \u201cbusiness partner\u201d of the prepaid account issuer under new \u00a7 1026.61(a)(5)(iii). As described in new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.i, the first arrangement is where the unaffiliated person that can extend credit, or its affiliate, has an agreement with the prepaid account issuer, or its affiliate, that allows a prepaid card from time to time to draw, transfer, or authorize a draw or transfer of credit from a separate credit feature offered by the person that can extend credit in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. New comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.i provides, however, that the parties are not considered to have such an agreement merely because the parties participate in a card network or payment network.",
                        "Second, new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.ii provides that an unaffiliated person that can extend credit through a separate credit feature is a business partner of the prepaid account issuer if (1) the prepaid account issuer or its affiliate has a business, marketing, or promotional agreement or other arrangement with the person that can extend credit, or its affiliate, where the agreement or arrangement provides that prepaid accounts offered by the prepaid account issuer will be marketed to the customers of the person who is extending credit, or that the credit feature will be marketed to the holders of prepaid accounts offered by the prepaid account issuer (including any marketing to customers to link the separate credit feature to the prepaid account to be used as an overdraft credit feature); and (2) at the time of the marketing agreement or arrangement, or at any time afterwards, the prepaid card from time to time can draw, transfer, or authorize the draw or transfer of credit from the separate credit feature in the course of transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. In this case, this requirement is satisfied even if there is no specific agreement between the parties that the card can access the separate credit feature, as described above under new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.i. For example, this requirement is satisfied even if the draw, transfer, or authorization of the draw or transfer from the separate credit feature is effectuated through a card network or payment network.",
                        "The Bureau is amending the commentary to existing \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(7)'s definition of card issuer to effectuate coverage of these relationships. Specifically, under the final rule, the Bureau is moving the existing language of current comment 2(a)(7)-1 to new comment 2(a)(7)-1.i. In addition, the Bureau is adding new comment 2(a)(7)-1.ii to provide that with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card where that credit feature is offered by an affiliate or business partner of the prepaid account issuer, the affiliate or business partner offering the credit feature is an agent of the prepaid account issuer and thus, is itself a card issuer with respect to the hybrid prepaid-credit card. Consistent with the general existing definition of card issuer, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to consider a prepaid account issuer's affiliate or business partner to be an \u201cagent\u201d of the prepaid account issuer because, in those cases, there is a sufficient connection between the parties such that the affiliate or business partner should know that its credit feature is accessible by a prepaid card as an overdraft credit feature for the prepaid account.",
                        "The Bureau notes that current comment 2(a)(7)-1 provides that a financial institution may become the agent of the card issuer if an agreement between the institution and the card issuer provides that the cardholder may use a line of credit with the financial institution to pay obligations incurred by use of the credit card. With regard to hybrid prepaid-credit cards, the final rule incorporates and expands upon this concept of when a person is an agent of a card issuer. The Bureau believes that the new, more expansive language provides additional clarity as to when there is an agent relationship in the prepaid context and, therefore, prevents circumvention of the final rules applicable to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined by new \u00a7\u20091026.61 that are offered by the prepaid account issuer's affiliates or business partners.",
                        "In particular, the Bureau is concerned that without new comment 2(a)(7)-1.ii, prepaid account issuers could structure arrangements with their affiliates or business partners to avoid an agency relationship under State law. Such a result could frustrate the operation of certain consumer protections provided in the final rule. In addition, without considering the person that can extend credit through the covered separate credit feature to be an agent of the prepaid account issuer (and thus considering both the prepaid account issuer and the person that can extend credit to be \u201ccard issuers\u201d), it may not be clear whether the person that can extend credit through the covered separate credit feature or the prepaid account issuer must comply with particular provisions in Regulation Z. For example, existing \u00a7\u20091026.51(a) provides that a card issuer must not open a credit card account for a consumer under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, or increase any credit limit applicable to such account, unless the card issuer considers the consumer's ability to make the required minimum periodic payments under the terms of the account based on the consumer's income or assets and the consumer's current obligations. In cases where the prepaid account issuer's affiliate or business partner offers the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card, it would not be clear what obligations under existing \u00a7\u20091026.51(a), if any, apply to the prepaid account issuer (who is a \u201ccard issuer\u201d but who is not offering the credit card account) and what obligations, if any, apply to the affiliate or business partner (who is offering the credit card account but is not a card issuer) if the affiliate or business partner were not a card issuer under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(7) with respect to the hybrid prepaid-credit card.",
                        "Accordingly, under the final rule, new comment 2(a)(7)-1.ii provides that with respect to a prepaid card that is a hybrid prepaid-credit card that can access a covered separate credit feature offered by an affiliate or business partner as those terms are defined in new \u00a7\u20091026.61, the affiliate or business partner offering the credit feature that is accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card is an agent of the prepaid account issuer and thus, is a card issuer with respect to the hybrid prepaid-credit card. As a result, in the example above related to existing \u00a7\u20091026.51(a), the affiliate or business partner would be a \u201ccard issuer\u201d for purposes of that provision and would be required to comply with it.",
                        "Nonetheless, as discussed in more detail below and in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2), the Bureau has decided to provide that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a credit feature that is offered by a third party that is not an affiliate or business partner of a prepaid account issuer, even if the consumer decides to link his or her prepaid card to the credit feature offered by the third party. This type of credit feature is a \u201cnon-covered separate credit feature\u201d as defined in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii). The Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate to subject such an unrelated third party to the provisions in the final rule applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards. In this case, there is not a sufficient connection between the prepaid account issuer and the unrelated third party, and the unrelated third party may not know that its separate credit feature is functioning as an overdraft credit feature with respect to the prepaid account.",
                        "Accordingly, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) below, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii) provides that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature discussed above. However, as described in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii), the unrelated third party that offers the non-covered separate credit feature typically will be subject to Regulation Z in its own right based on the terms and conditions of the separate credit feature, independent of the connection to the prepaid account."

Consistent with this approach, proposed comment 2(a)(7)-2 would have explained that a person is not a card issuer where a prepaid card only accesses credit meeting this description.

The second is where the separate credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party, rather than the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. In addition, under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61 or a credit card under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features.

This revision to final comment 7(b)(13)-1 clarifies that if a financial institution elects to provide a periodic statement under existing Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.9(b) to a holder of the prepaid account, the financial institution is permitted to combine the Regulation E and Regulation Z periodic statements. In this case, the financial institution must satisfy the requirements of both Regulation E and Regulation Z in providing the combined statement. If a financial institution instead elects to follow the periodic statement alternative set forth in final Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1), the financial institution still is required to provide Regulation Z periodic statements in writing pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091026.7. Under existing \u00a7\u20091026.5(a)(1)(iii), financial institutions are permitted to provide the Regulation Z periodic statements in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act."

As described in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11) above, these fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges under new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.

As such, the Bureau believes that these fees are more appropriately disclosed on the Regulation E disclosures for the asset feature of the prepaid account and should not be disclosed as well on the Regulation Z disclosures with respect to the covered separate credit feature.

Existing \u00a7\u20091026.7(b)(11)(ii) provides, however, that the requirements of existing \u00a7\u20091026.(b)(11)(i) do not apply to the following: (1) Periodic statements provided solely for charge card accounts; and (2) periodic statements provided for a charged-off account where payment of the entire account balance is due immediately.",

If the due date disclosure requirement and the 21-day rule for delivery of periodic statements applied to charge card accounts, the card issuer could no longer require payment upon delivery of the statement. Thus, the Board concluded that it would not be appropriate to apply the payment due date disclosure in existing \u00a7\u20091026.7(b)(11)(i)(A) to periodic statements provided solely for charge card accounts.",

The Bureau believes that card issuers that offer covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may rely significantly on obtaining a consumer's written authorization of daily or weekly debits to the prepaid account to repay the credit card debt given the overall creditworthiness of prepaid accountholders who choose to use covered separate credit features. The Bureau also believes that card issuers that offer covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may be able to obtain a consumer's written authorization to debit the prepaid account for the credit card debt more easily than for other types of credit card accounts because consumers may believe that, in order to obtain credit, they have no alternative but to provide written authorization to allow a card issuer to deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from the linked prepaid account.",

                        "As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.7(b)(11) and 1026.12(d)(3) below, the Bureau believes that it is important to provide strong protections to prepaid accountholders to ensure that they can control when and if funds are swept from their accounts to repay credit extended through a covered separate credit feature. In particular, the Bureau believes that for all covered separate credit features\u2014including charge card accounts\u2014accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, where these credit features are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, the card issuer should be required to adopt reasonable procedures designed to ensure that periodic statements for these credit features are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the statement, pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091026.7(b)(11)(i)(A). As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.7(b)(11) and 1026.12(d)(3), the Bureau believes that this requirement, along with changes to the offset prohibition in final \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(3), will ensure that the due date of the covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is not so closely aligned with the timing of when funds are deposited into the prepaid account that card issuers can circumvent TILA's offset prohibition.",
                        "As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(3) below, the Bureau is concerned that with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, some card issuers may attempt to circumvent the prohibition on offsets by both specifying that each transaction on the covered separate credit feature is due on the date on which funds are subsequently deposited into the account and obtaining a consumer's written authorization to deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from the prepaid account when deposits are received into the prepaid account. The Bureau believes that card issuers that offer covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may rely significantly on obtaining a consumer's written authorization of daily or weekly debits to the prepaid account to repay the credit card debt given the overall creditworthiness of prepaid accountholders who choose to rely on covered separate credit features. The Bureau also believes that card issuers that offer covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may be able to obtain a consumer's written authorization to debit the prepaid account more easily than for other types of credit card accounts because consumers may believe that, in order to obtain credit, they must provide written authorization to allow a card issuer to deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from the linked prepaid account."

Specifically, the statute provides that no payment of any fees (other than any late fee, over-the-limit fee, or fee for a payment returned for insufficient funds) may be made from the credit made available under the terms of the account where the account terms would require consumers to pay an aggregate amount of non-exempt fees in excess of 25 percent of the total amount of credit authorized under the account when the account is opened.",
                "This provision is implemented in existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(a). Specifically, existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(a)(1) provides that generally the total amount of fees a consumer is required to pay with respect to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan during the first year after account opening must not exceed 25 percent of the credit limit in effect when the account is opened. Under existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(a)(2), fees not subject to the 25 percent restriction are late payment fees, over-the-limit fees, returned-payment fees, or fees that the consumer is not required to pay with respect to the account. Existing comment 52(a)(1)-1 provides that the 25 percent limit in existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(a)(1) applies to fees that the card issuer charges to the account as well as to fees that the card issuer requires the consumer to pay with respect to the account through other means (such as through a payment from the consumer's asset account to the card issuer or from another credit account provided by the card issuer).",
                "The proposal would have amended existing comment 52(a)(1)-1 to add a prepaid account as an example of a consumer's asset account.

Proposed comment 52(a)(1)-1.iii and iv would have added two new examples to existing comment52(a)(1)-1 to illustrate how the prohibition in existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(a) would have applied to credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan that are accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards.",
                "One industry trade association indicated that the Bureau should not apply the 25 percent cap to fees imposed for overdrafts on prepaid accounts or should include broader exemptions for fees (such as for cash advance fees) that are more appropriately tailored for prepaid account usage. This commenter believed that the 25 percent cap on fees imposed during the first year the credit card account is opened will likely make it cost-prohibitive for issuers to provide overdraft and other credit features.",

One of the consumer groups indicated that in the alternative, the rule could state that any increase in the credit limit under a credit feature accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card constitutes a new credit agreement and results in another year where fees cannot exceed 25 percent of the credit limit. This commenter indicated that without this safeguard, a card issuer could offer a very small amount of credit free of charge for a year, and then increase the credit limit after the first year while charging any fees it wishes, potentially causing cardholders serious harm.",

                "The Bureau sought comment on whether additional amendments to the regulation or commentary would be helpful to effectuate its interpretation of the statute or to facilitate compliance. For example, the Bureau sought comment on whether it would be helpful to mandate the disclosure to consumers of the initial credit line that is made available under the terms of the account, including any linked credit accounts. One consumer group commenter also indicated that with respect to a credit feature accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards, card issuers should be required to disclose to consumers the credit limit that will apply to the credit feature. This commenter indicated that consumers should not have to guess at their credit limits. This commenter indicated that the restrictions in existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(a) cannot fully protect consumers unless they know what their credit limit is and can check to see if fees exceed 25 percent of that limit.",

In addition, the Bureau has not provided that that any increase in the credit limit under a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card constitutes a new credit agreement and results in another year where fees cannot exceed 25 percent of the credit limit. Also, the Bureau has not exempted additional credit-related fees (such as for cash advance fees) from the restriction in existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(a), as requested by one industry commenter as discussed above.

For customer-service reasons and other reasons, credit card issuers typically disclose the credit limits applicable to credit card accounts to consumers even though that disclosure is not specifically required by TILA and Regulation Z. For similar reasons, the Bureau believes that card issuers that are providing covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards will have an incentive to disclose the credit limits on these credit features as well. For these reasons, the Bureau at this time does not believe that it is necessary under Regulation Z to require that card issuers providing covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards must disclose a credit limit with respect to these credit features."

                "The Bureau is adding new \u00a7\u20091026.61 which defines when a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z (using the term \u201chybrid prepaid-credit card\u201d). As discussed in the <em data-original=\"E-03\">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section above and in more detail below, the Bureau generally intends to cover under Regulation Z overdraft credit features in connection with prepaid accounts where the credit features are offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or its business partners. Section 1026.61(b) generally requires that such credit features be structured as separate subaccounts or accounts, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with various Regulation Z requirements. New \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a \u201chybrid prepaid-credit card\u201d with respect to a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. New \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2)(i) defines such a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as a \u201ccovered separate credit feature.\u201d Thus, the hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",

                "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61 below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii) provides that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature that does not meet both of the conditions above, for example, where the credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate or its business partner. Such credit features are defined as \u201cnon-covered separate credit features,\u201d as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) below. Second, under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61 or a credit card under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.",
                "New comment 61(a)-1 explains that in addition to the rules set forth in new \u00a7\u20091026.61, hybrid prepaid-credit cards and covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards are also subject to other rules in Regulation Z, and some of those rules and related commentary contain specific guidance related to hybrid prepaid-credit cards and covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. For example, as discussed in the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) and 1026.61(a), a hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card for purposes of this regulation with respect to a covered separate credit feature. A covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card also will be a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, as defined in final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(ii), if the covered separate credit feature is an open-end (not home-secured) credit plan. Thus, the provisions of Regulation Z that apply to credit cards and credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan generally will apply to hybrid prepaid-credit cards and covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as applicable (<em data-original=\"E-03\">see generally</em> subparts B and G).

By authorizing or paying a transaction where the consumer does not have sufficient or available funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transaction when the transaction is authorized or paid, the person is allowing the consumer to incur a debt with the person where payment of that debt is not immediate. Thus, the person, in extending overdraft funds, has provided the consumer with \u201cthe right . . . to incur debt and defer its payment.\u201d",
                        "The Bureau further emphasizes that the final rule does not change how overdraft services on accounts other than prepaid accounts are treated under Regulation Z. As discussed in more detail in the <em data-original=\"E-03\">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section, with respect to overdraft services on checking accounts, while a person that is providing overdraft services generally would be providing credit under TILA and Regulation Z, the person generally does not meet the definition of \u201ccreditor\u201d for purposes of Regulation Z because of certain exclusions to the definition of finance charge under final \u00a7 1026.4(c)(3). Thus, under this final rule, with respect to overdraft services on checking accounts, a financial institution that does not agree in writing to pay the items and does not structure the repayment of the credit by written agreement in more than four installments would not be a \u201ccreditor\u201d with respect to the overdraft service under the general definition of creditor set forth in \u00a7 1026.2(a)(17)(i), even if the institution charges a fee for paying the overdraft item, because the fee would not be a \u201cfinance charge.\u201d In addition, a person does not become a card issuer or a creditor by issuing a debit card that accesses an overdraft service. Specifically, existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.A provides that a debit card is not a credit card if there is no credit feature or agreement to extend credit, even if the creditor occasionally honors an inadvertent overdraft. Thus, a person does not become a card issuer under existing \u00a7 1026.2(a)(7) and does not become a creditor under existing \u00a7 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) or (iv) by issuing a debit card that accesses an overdraft service. The final rule does not change the provisions in Regulation Z effectuating this treatment of overdraft services on accounts other than prepaid accounts."

                        "As discussed above, several industry commenters suggested that the Bureau should consider a dollar threshold below which overdraft transactions would not be covered as \u201ccredit\u201d under Regulation Z. For example, one credit union service organization urged the Bureau to set a threshold of $250 for when overdraft funds are considered \u201ccredit\u201d under Regulation Z, where negative balances on the prepaid account exceeding $250 in magnitude would meet the definition of \u201ccredit\u201d and negative balances on the prepaid account of $250 in magnitude or below would not be \u201ccredit\u201d under Regulation Z. The Bureau does not adopt such an approach. The Bureau is concerned that allowing consumers to incur substantial debt in connection with a prepaid account that most consumers do not intend to use as a credit account may pose a risk to those consumers by compromising their ability to manage and control their finances. Thus, while new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) would permit a prepaid account issuer to offer an incidental \u201cpayment cushion\u201d of $10 without triggering the rules governing credit cards under Regulation Z so long as the issuer generally does not impose credit-related fees, the Bureau believes that the provision of a higher dollar amount of credit in connection with a prepaid account should be subject to full credit card protections unless otherwise excluded under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)."

See the <em data-original=\"E-03\">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section for a discussion of those comments. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.61 below, the Bureau is revising from the proposal the circumstances in which a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z. Under final \u00a7 1026.2(a)(15)(i), a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z when it is a \u201chybrid prepaid-credit card\u201d as defined in new \u00a7 1026.61. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See also</em> new \u00a7 1026.61(a), and new comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F. The Bureau generally intends to cover under Regulation Z overdraft credit features in connection with prepaid accounts where the credit features are offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or its business partners. New \u00a7 1026.61(b) generally requires that such credit features be structured as separate subaccounts or accounts, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with various Regulation Z requirements. Specifically, new \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a \u201chybrid prepaid-credit card\u201d with respect to a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. The term \u201ccovered separate credit feature\u201d is defined in new \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2)(i) to mean a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as described in new \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2)(i). Thus, the hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",
                        "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61 below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii) provides that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature that does not meet both of the conditions above, for example, where the credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate or its business partner. Such credit features are defined as \u201cnon-covered separate credit features,\u201d as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) below. Second, under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61 or a credit card under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features.

This definition also includes a business, marketing, or promotional agreement between a card issuer and a college or university (or an affiliated organization, such as an alumni club or a foundation) if (1) the agreement provides for the issuance of prepaid accounts as defined in \u00a7\u20091026.61 to full-time or part-time students; and (2) a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan may be added in the future to the prepaid account.",
                        "Pursuant to the Bureau's amendments to commentary, final \u00a7\u20091026.57(d) requires a card issuer that is a party to one or more college credit card agreements in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards to submit annual reports to the Bureau regarding those agreements. In addition, a card issuer is required to submit agreements that provide for the issuance of prepaid accounts to full-time or part-time students even if a covered separate credit feature is not linked to the prepaid account when the prepaid accounts are issued, so long as such credit features may be added in connection with the prepaid accounts.",
                        "As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(c) below, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(c) provides that with respect to a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card at any point, a card issuer must not do any of the following until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered: (1) Open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; (2) make a solicitation or provide an application to open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; or (3) allow an existing credit feature that was opened prior to the consumer obtaining the prepaid account to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card. Thus, a prepaid card in connection with a prepaid account cannot access a covered separate credit feature at the time the prepaid account is opened. Nonetheless, the Bureau believes that the marketing efforts related to a prepaid account, including the inducements given by a card issuer to open a prepaid account, have an impact on whether consumers may request that a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card be linked to the prepaid account when such covered separate credit features are offered to them. Thus, even though a prepaid account will not have a covered separate credit feature linked to it at the time the prepaid account is opened, if a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be linked to a prepaid account as described above in the future, the prepaid account at the time of issuance would be a \u201ccollege student credit card\u201d for purposes of final \u00a7\u20091026.57(a)(1) if the prepaid account is issued to a college student. As a result, under the final rule, a card issuer that is a party to one or more agreements between the card issuer and a college or university (or an affiliated organization, such as an alumni club or a foundation) must submit annual reports to the Bureau regarding those agreements if: (1) An agreement provides for the issuance of prepaid accounts to full-time or part-time students; and (2) a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be added in connection with the prepaid account.",
                        "The Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its adjustment authority under TILA section 105(a), to apply section 127(r)'s requirements for college card agreements to prepaid cards where covered separate credit features that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may subsequently be added, to further the purposes of TILA. The provisions in TILA section 127(r) addressing college credit cards reflect Congress's particular concern with providing special protections for students to ensure that students can make informed credit decisions, and the Bureau believes that including such cards is consistent with such congressional concerns for college students and credit card debt. Further, these concerns might be heightened with respect to prepaid accounts to which covered separate credit features that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may be linked because students might be prone to use such prepaid accounts as their primary transaction account."

As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61 and a credit card under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",
                        "New comment 8(a)-9 recognizes that a card issuer with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may structure the overdraft credit feature in two ways to cover situations where the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time of authorization or settlement to cover the amount of the transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. With respect to the first way, new comment 8(a)-9.i explains that the covered separate credit feature could be structured such that a consumer can use a hybrid prepaid-credit card to make a purchase to obtain goods or services from a merchant, and credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature without transferring funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase. For example, assume that the consumer has $10 of funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and initiates a transaction with a merchant to obtain goods or services with the hybrid prepaid-credit card for $25. In this case, $10 is debited from the asset feature, and $15 of credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature accessed by the hybrid prepaid-credit card without any transfer of funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase.",
                        "New comment 8(a)-9.i provides that such a transaction is a \u201csale credit\u201d under final \u00a7\u20091026.8(a). In this example, the $15 credit transaction will be treated as \u201csale credit\u201d under final \u00a7\u20091026.8(a).",

For example, again, assume that the consumer has $10 of funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and initiates a transaction with a merchant to obtain goods or services with the hybrid prepaid-credit card for $25. In this case, the $15 is transferred from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature, and a transaction of $25 is debited from the asset feature of the prepaid account.",
                        "New comments 8(a)-9.ii provides that such a transaction is a \u201cnonsale credit\u201d under final \u00a7\u20091026.8(b). In this example, the $15 credit transaction is treated as \u201cnonsale credit\u201d under \u00a7\u20091026.8(b). The Bureau notes, however, that while this type of credit transaction is disclosed as \u201cnonsale credit\u201d under final \u00a7\u20091026.8(b) on the Regulation Z periodic statement, this transaction is still considered a transaction made with the card to purchase goods or services under final \u00a7\u20091026.12(c) and would be subject to final \u00a7\u20091026.12(c).

The Bureau believes that this distinction will help consumers better recognize and understand the credit transactions when they are disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement. The Bureau believes that this is particularly true when a transaction involves situations where the hybrid prepaid-credit card is used to obtain goods or services from a merchant and the transaction is partially paid with funds from the asset feature of the consumer's prepaid account, and partially paid with credit from a covered separate credit feature.",
                        "As discussed above, a credit transaction will be disclosed as \u201csale credit\u201d on the Regulation Z periodic statement where a consumer uses a hybrid prepaid-credit card to make a purchase to obtain goods or services from a merchant, and credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature to cover the amount of the purchase without transferring funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account. New comment 8(a)-9.iii provides for these types of transactions, if a hybrid prepaid-credit card is used to obtain goods or services from a merchant and the transaction is partially funded by the consumer's prepaid account and partially funded by credit from the covered separate credit feature, the amount to be disclosed under final \u00a7\u20091026.8(a) as a \u201csale credit' is the amount of the credit extension, not the total amount of the purchase transaction.",

In this case, $10 is debited from the asset feature, and $15 of credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature to cover the amount of the purchase without any transfer of funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account. The $15 credit transaction is disclosed as \u201csale credit\u201d on the Regulation Z periodic statement, and the $10 part of the transaction is disclosed on the Regulation E periodic statement under existing Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.9(b), or alternatively, on the electronic and written account transaction histories pursuant to the periodic statement alternative under final Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1).",
                        "In this example, because the credit transaction is treated as \u201csale credit\u201d under existing \u00a7\u20091026.8(a), the following information regarding the credit portion of the transaction (the $15 credit portion, in the example above) generally will be disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement: (1) The amount of the transaction; (2) the date of the transaction; (3) the merchant's name; and (4) the merchant's location. In this example, as set forth in existing Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.9(b)(1) and final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(3), similar information will be disclosed on the Regulation E periodic statement, or alternatively, the electronic and written account transaction histories regarding the portion of the transaction that involves asset funds ($10 in the above example), namely: (1) The amount of the transaction; (2) the date of the transaction; (3) the merchant's name; and (4) the merchant's location. The Bureau believes that because both parts of the transaction are disclosed consistently on the Regulation Z and Regulation E periodic statements (or on the electronic and written account transaction histories provided to consumers pursuant to the periodic statement alternative under final Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1)), a consumer will be better able to match up the two parts of the transaction. Thus, the Bureau does not believe that it is necessary in this case to disclose both portions of the transaction on each periodic statement, as suggested by a consumer group commenter as discussed above.",
                        "The Bureau recognizes that for purchases of goods or services that involve overdrafts on asset accounts that are executed via debit cards, the credit transaction may be disclosed as nonsale credit. In particular, comment 8(b)-1.iii provides that nonsale credit includes the use of an overdraft credit plan accessed by a debit card, even if such use is in connection with a purchase of goods or services. In a 1981 rulemaking implementing the Truth in Lending Simplification and Reform Act, the Board indicated that several commenters requested clarification regarding whether a creditor should identify a transaction as sale or nonsale credit when a consumer uses a debit card with an overdraft feature to purchase goods, and in doing so, activates the overdraft. The Board expressed its belief that the credit portions of such transactions could be viewed as cash advances, and therefore permitted the credit portions to be disclosed as nonsale credit at the creditor's option even though a purchase is involved.<footnote ref=\"637\">46 FR 20848, 20861 (Apr. 7, 1981).</footnote>\n             As discussed in the <em data-original=\"E-03\">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section, the Bureau is not intending to revise rules in Regulation Z that apply to overdraft plans accessed by debit cards. Nonetheless, for transactions discussed above with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, the Bureau believes that disclosing the credit transaction as sale credit would be more helpful to consumers than disclosing the transaction as nonsale credit because consumers would receive the seller's name, and the city and State or foreign country where the transaction took place.",
                        "If the credit transaction were treated as nonsale credit, the consumer would not receive the information about the seller's name and address. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the information about the seller's name and address may be useful to consumers in identifying the credit transactions where a hybrid prepaid-credit card is used to obtain goods or services from a merchant, and credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature to cover the amount of the purchase without transferring funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account. As discussed above, the Bureau also notes that under Regulation E, on the periodic statement, or the electronic and written account transaction histories under the periodic statement alternative, a transaction that involves a withdrawal from the prepaid account at point of sale must include the merchant's name and location. Thus, as discussed above, with respect to a single transaction that involves both a withdrawal from the prepaid account and an extension of credit, disclosing such a credit transaction as sale credit could help consumers match up the part of the transaction that appears on the Regulation Z periodic statement with the part of the transaction that appears on the Regulation E periodic statement or account transaction history.",

For example, again assume that the consumer has $10 of funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and initiates a transaction with a merchant to obtain goods or services with the hybrid prepaid-credit card for $25. In this case, $15 will be transferred from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature, and a transaction of $25 is debited from the asset feature of the prepaid account.",

The Regulation E periodic statement or account transaction histories also will show information about the purchase transaction made with the card.

In this case, the card issuer may only be able to determine the total amount of credit extended for that transaction. To ensure that consumers are better able to recognize credit transactions disclosed on periodic statements, new comment 8(a)-9.iii requires that a creditor disclose the entire amount of the credit transaction as \u201csale credit\u201d under final \u00a7\u20091026.8(a). Under this approach, a creditor must disclose the entire amount of the credit transaction, the date of the transaction, and the merchant's name and location on the Regulation Z periodic statement. The Bureau believes such information is sufficient to allow a consumer to identify a transaction, even where part of the amount of the transaction is for cash back or other forms of credit given to the cardholder at point of sale. For these types of transactions, the Bureau anticipates that the cardholder will associate the entire credit transaction, including the cash back portion of the credit, with the merchant's name."

Fees described in final \u00a7\u20091026.4(c) through (e), as applicable, are excluded from the definition of finance charge, although, as discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is narrowing certain of these existing exclusions as they are applied to credit offered in connection with prepaid accounts.",
                "The Bureau's approach with regard to fees charged on an asset feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is consistent with the comparable cash exception to the definition of finance charge. This approach is similar to the existing approach that Regulation Z takes outside the credit card context in exempting fees from the definition of finance charge if they are comparable to fees charged on a checking or other asset account for transactions that do not involve a credit feature as discussed in final \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(2), although there are important distinctions as discussed below.",
                "Compared to the proposed approach, the Bureau believes that the approach adopted in the final rule with respect to the asset feature will make it easier for both prepaid account issuers and for consumers to track and understand how the separate credit feature and asset features operate in connection with a hybrid prepaid-credit card. The Bureau is concerned that excluding all fees charged on an asset feature from the definition of finance charge would invite prepaid account issuers to structure their programs in ways that make it very difficult for consumers to analyze the true cost of credit on a hybrid prepaid-credit card. At the same time, the Bureau recognizes that certain fees charged in conjunction with the operation of the prepaid asset feature are not driven by credit use, and that it is useful to both prepaid account issuers and consumers to differentiate those fees from other charges. The Bureau believes that new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) appropriately balances these considerations by providing that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are finance charges only to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card."

This guidance is more detailed and more restrictive than the guidance provided under final \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(2) with regard to checking and transaction accounts other than prepaid accounts.",

The first type of credit extension is where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The second type of credit extension is where a consumer makes a standalone draw or transfer of credit from the covered separate credit feature, outside the course of any transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or service, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. For example, a consumer may use the prepaid card at the prepaid account issuer's Web site to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Because the two scenarios involve different sets of activities, the range of fees triggered is also likely to be different. As discussed in more detail below, new comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1 therefore provides separate guidance on the comparable fees under new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) with respect to each of the two types of credit extensions.",

Specifically, new comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.ii provides that where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing such a transaction, any per transaction fees imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account, including load and transfer fees, for such credit from the credit feature should be compared to the per transaction fees for each transaction to access funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account that is in the same prepaid account program but does not have such a credit feature. Thus, per transaction fees for a transaction that is conducted to load or draw funds into a prepaid account from some other source are not comparable for purposes of new \u00a7 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).",

As a result, the Bureau does not believe that a per transaction fee for credit drawn or transferred from a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card during the course of a transaction should be allowed to be compared with a per transaction fee for a service that many prepaid cardholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not be able to use.",

This could allow the prepaid account issuer to avoid charging a finance charge and avoid the application of the Credit CARD Act provisions that are generally set forth in subpart G, such as the restriction on fees set forth in \u00a7\u20091026.52.

As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.4(a) above, existing comment 4(a)-4 provides guidance on when transaction charges imposed on credit card accounts are finance charges under \u00a7\u20091026.4(a).<footnote ref=\"619\">Transaction charges that are imposed on checking accounts or other transaction accounts (other than prepaid accounts) are discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.4(b) above, and transaction charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card are discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) below.</footnote>\n             Specifically, existing comment 4(a)-4 provides that any transaction charge imposed on a cardholder by a card issuer is a finance charge, regardless of whether the issuer imposes the same, greater, or lesser charge on withdrawals of funds from an asset account, such as a checking or savings account. For example, any charge imposed on a credit cardholder by a card issuer for the use of an ATM to obtain a cash advance (whether in a proprietary, shared, interchange, or other system) is a finance charge regardless of whether the card issuer imposes a charge on its debit cardholders for using the ATM to withdraw cash from a consumer asset account, such as a checking or savings account. In addition, any charge imposed on a credit cardholder for making a purchase or obtaining a cash advance outside the United States with a foreign merchant, or in a foreign currency, is a finance charge, regardless of whether a charge is imposed on debit cardholders for such transactions. This comment essentially provides that debit card transactions are not considered \u201ccomparable cash transactions\u201d to credit card transactions with respect to transaction charges imposed by a card issuer on a credit cardholder when those fees are imposed on the credit card account.",
                "In the supplemental information accompanying the rule that adopted this comment, the Board noted the inherent complexity of distinguishing transactions that are \u201ccomparable cash transactions\u201d to credit card transactions from transactions that are not.<footnote ref=\"620\">74 FR 5244, 5263 (Jan. 29, 2009).</footnote>\n\n             For example, the Board discussed the case where a card issuer imposes a transaction fee on the credit card account for a cash advance obtained through an ATM. The Board found that a transaction fee for a cash advance obtained through an ATM would not always be a finance charge if fees that are imposed on debit cards offered by the credit card issuer were considered in applying the \u201ccomparable cash transaction\u201d exception. In particular, whether the transaction fee for the cash advance is a finance charge would depend on whether the credit card issuer provided asset accounts and offered debit cards on those accounts and whether the fee exceeds the fee imposed for a cash advance transaction through an ATM on such asset accounts. The Board believed this type of distinction was not helpful for consumers in understanding transaction fees imposed on their credit card accounts. Thus, the Board adopted existing comment 4(a)-4, which provides that any transaction charge imposed on a cardholder by a card issuer is a finance charge, regardless of whether the issuer imposes the same, greater, or lesser charge on withdrawals of funds from an asset account, such as a checking or savings account. The Board noted that it was not revising existing comment 4(b)(2)-1, which states that if a checking or transaction account charge imposed on an account with a credit feature does not exceed the charge for an account without a credit feature, the charge is not a finance charge. The Board further noted that existing comment 4(b)(2)-1 addresses situations distinct from those addressed by comment 4(a)-4.",
                "With respect to whether a per transaction charge imposed on the covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card should be a finance charge, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to follow the same rules that generally apply to credit cards, as set forth in existing comment 4(a)-4. Thus, consistent with existing comment 4(a)-4, any transaction charge imposed on a cardholder by a card issuer on a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is a finance charge. With regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, transaction charges that are imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account are subject to new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) and related commentary, instead of new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(i)."

Such transactions would have been credit accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card under the proposal regardless of whether the person established a separate credit account to extend the credit or whether the credit was simply reflected as a negative balance on the prepaid account.",
                        "The proposal would not have applied the credit card rules in situations in which a prepaid card only assessed credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in \u00a7\u20091026.4, or fee described in \u00a7\u20091026.4(c), and was not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Specifically, the proposal provided that the prepaid card in such situations would not have been a credit card. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.4 above, the proposal also included revisions to the definition of \u201cfinance charge\u201d in \u00a7\u20091026.4(a) and (b)(2) and their related commentary to delineate when a fee imposed in relation to credit accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card would have been a finance charge under \u00a7\u20091026.4. In general, the proposal would have treated any transaction charges imposed on a cardholder by a card issuer on a prepaid account in connection with credit accessed by a prepaid card as a finance charge, regardless of how the amount of the fees compared to fees the issuer charged on non-credit transactions or accounts that did not involve credit access. The Bureau recognized that, under the proposal, if a prepaid account issuer would have imposed a per transaction fee on a prepaid account for any transactions authorized or settled on the prepaid account, the prepaid account issuer would have needed to waive that per transaction fee imposed on the prepaid account when the transaction accessed credit in order to take advantage of the proposed exception for when a prepaid card would not be a credit card under the proposal.",

Proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.G would have provided that these account numbers were credit cards under the proposal.",
                        "This proposal language would have covered credit plans that are not accessed directly by prepaid cards but instead are structured as \u201cpush\u201d accounts. Under such a credit plan, a person would provide credit accessed by an account number where such extensions of credit may only be deposited directly into particular prepaid accounts specified by the person and cannot be deposited directly into another asset account, such as a deposit account. For example, such a credit plan may allow a consumer to use an account number to request that an extension of credit be deposited directly into a particular prepaid account specified by the creditor when the consumer does not have adequate funds in the prepaid account to cover the full amount of a transaction using the prepaid card. In the proposal, the Bureau expressed concern that these types of credit plans could act as substitutes for credit plans directly accessed by a prepaid card. The Bureau did not, however, propose to cover general purpose lines of credit where a consumer has the freedom to choose where to deposit directly the credit funds."

                        "In response to the proposal, several commenters expressed concern about the way the proposal would have applied the credit card rules to credit products that were structured as standalone plans or products, rather than as negative balances on the prepaid account. An issuing credit union requested clarification that the proposal would have applied the credit card rules to situations in which a prepaid card could be used to initiate the load or transfer of credit to a prepaid account, but this load or transfer could not occur in course of processing transactions conducted with the card when there were insufficient funds in the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transaction. This commenter noted that consumers can consciously load value to their prepaid account using their debit card or credit card, where this load is not occurring as part of an overdraft feature in connection with the prepaid account. When using the debit card, the consumer may consciously load funds from an overdraft or line of credit product that is linked to a traditional checking account. When using a credit card, the consumer is loading credit from an available credit card balance to fund the prepaid account. This commenter urged the Bureau to clarify that such loads do not make the prepaid card into a credit card under Regulation Z.",
                        "On the other hand, as discussed above, several consumer group commenters suggested that the credit card rules should apply to a credit account even if the credit account did not function as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account, so long as credit from the credit account was deposited into the prepaid account. These commenters urged the Bureau to apply the credit card rules to all credit transferred to a prepaid account, even if there is another way to access the credit.",
                        "Another consumer group commenter suggested that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all open-end lines of credit where credit is deposited or transferred to prepaid accounts if either (1) the creditor is the same institution as or has a business relationship with the prepaid issuer; or (2) the creditor reasonably anticipates that a prepaid card will be used as an access device for the line of credit. Nonetheless, this commenter said that the final rule should not impact a completely unrelated credit account that has no connection to prepaid issuers or consumers identified as prepaid card users, even though the creditor allows credit to be transferred from the credit account through the ACH system.",
                        "Two industry trade associations said the Bureau should not consider a prepaid card to be a credit card with respect to a separate credit feature when the credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party rather than the prepaid account issuer or an associated company. These commenters indicated that such unrelated third-party creditors are not in a position to know that they have additional obligations under Regulation Z at the point in time that a prepaid account issuer or a consumer chooses to use a credit feature offered by the unrelated third-party creditor as a form of overdraft credit feature in relation to a prepaid account. Several other commenters, including an industry trade association, a program manager, and several issuing banks, requested clarification that a prepaid card would not be a credit card under the proposal where it accesses credit deposited into the prepaid account from a separate credit feature offered by an unrelated third-party creditor. These commenters argued that prepaid account issuer may not know that the deposited funds are credit.",
                        "On the other hand, several consumer groups supported the proposed rule's approach in considering a third party that offers an open-end credit feature accessed by a prepaid card to be an agent of the prepaid account issuer and thus a credit card issuer with responsibilities under Regulation Z. They believed the proposed rule would deter evasion by third-party creditors that allow their credit features to be used as an overdraft credit feature accessed by prepaid cards."

These commenters said that the Bureau should instead subject overdraft credit programs where there is not an agreement to the opt-in regime in Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.17, which currently applies to overdraft services provided for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. Several commenters, including industry trade associations, a credit union service organization, a credit reporting agency, and a program manager, also asserted that overdraft credit does not meet the definition of \u201ccredit\u201d under TILA because with respect to overdraft credit, there is no right to defer payment and/or no right to incur debt. These comments are discussed in more detail in the <em data-original=\"E-03\">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section and in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.2(a)(14) above.",
                        "In commenting on the specifics of the Regulation Z proposal, many industry commenters were concerned that because of the breadth of the fees that would be considered finance charges under the proposal, a prepaid account issuer either could not charge general transactional fees on the prepaid account or would have to waive certain fees on any transaction that happened to have involved credit, as defined under the proposal, in order to avoid triggering the credit card rules.",
                        "For example, one payment network indicated that a prepaid card should not be a credit card when it accesses credit extended through a negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account if the <em data-original=\"E-03\">only</em> fees charged on the prepaid account in connection with the extension of credit are the <em data-original=\"E-03\">very same</em> fees that would apply to the same transaction on the prepaid card without an extension of credit. Similarly, two industry trade associations urged that a prepaid card should be a credit card when it accesses credit extended through a negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account only if the prepaid account issuer charges fees directly correlated with the overdraft in question. These commenters argued that a prepaid card should not be a credit card when it accesses credit extended through a negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account if the prepaid account issuer only imposes on the prepaid account fees or charges that are wholly unrelated to an overdraft, such as a fee to make a balance inquiry at an ATM. These commenters also indicated that a prepaid card should not be a credit card when the prepaid account issuer only imposes unrelated fees or charges on the prepaid account, even when these unrelated fees or charges are imposed when the prepaid account balance is negative.",
                        "Another industry trade association indicated that a monthly fee to hold the prepaid account should not be a \u201cfinance charge\u201d simply because it may be imposed when the balance on the prepaid account is negative or because negative balances can occur on the prepaid account.",
                        "A program manager indicated that the Bureau should clarify that a prepaid card is not a credit card simply because the prepaid account issuer charges reasonable debt collection costs (including attorney's fees) related to collecting the overdraft credit from a consumer.",
                        "Many industry commenters were particularly concerned that under the proposal, a prepaid account issuer would need to waive per transaction fees in certain circumstances to avoid triggering the credit card rules. The circumstances raised by industry commenters centered on: (1) Force pay transactions; (2) payment cushions; and (3) transactions that take the account negative when a load of funds from an asset account is pending. These comments are discussed below and in further detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4).",
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Force pay transactions.</em> \u201cForce pay\u201d transactions occur where the prepaid account issuer is required by card network rules to pay a transaction even though there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the transaction at settlement. This can occur, for example, where a transaction is either not authorized in advance, or where there were sufficient or available funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time the transaction is authorized, but there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature at the time the transaction is settled, and a negative balance results on the asset feature when the transaction is paid. Because the proposal's definition of finance charge was broad, a force pay transaction would have triggered application of the credit card rules unless the prepaid account issuer would have waived transaction fees. Industry commenters were nearly universally concerned about this outcome, arguing that the credit card rules should not apply so long as the same fee amount applies regardless of whether the transaction is paid entirely from funds in the prepaid account or is paid in whole or in part by credit. Industry commenters said requiring prepaid account issuers to waive per transaction fees to avoid triggering the credit card rules on all force pay transactions would be complicated and thus would impose substantial compliance costs. These commenters indicated that similar issues also may arise with other per transaction fees, such as currency conversion fees when assessed on force pay transactions.",
                        "One payment network predicted that if the proposal were finalized, rather than create complex waiver rules, a prepaid account issuer might instead impose much stricter authorization rules in order to prevent inadvertent overdrafts. This commenter indicated that this could make it more difficult for prepaid cardholders to use their cards at gas pumps, restaurants, hotels, or other locations where these overdrafts from force pay transactions are most likely to occur.",
                        "One program manager also indicated that while issuers of other prepaid products could possibly avoid being subject to the credit rules by changing their fee structure (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> charging a monthly fee to hold the prepaid account instead of charging a per transaction fee), such an option is not available in the payroll card context because State wage and hour laws prohibit periodic fees on payroll card accounts.",
                        "With respect to force pay transactions, one consumer group commenter supported requiring a prepaid account issuer to waive the per transaction fee imposed on a credit transaction where credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account in order to avoid triggering the credit card rules under the proposal. Nonetheless, this commenter indicated that if the Bureau decides to make any exceptions with respect to force pay transactions, these exceptions should be limited to prepaid account issuers who do everything possible to prevent overdrafts, have overdrafts in only very rare and unpreventable situations, and do not charge penalty fees related to declined transactions, overdrafts, or negative balances.",
                        "Another consumer group commenter similarly urged that if the Bureau decides to provide an exception for force pay transactions, the exception should only be allowed if the prepaid account issuer does not charge a fee to account holders who have a negative balance, and the exception should only be provided to those prepaid account issuers that take reasonable steps to minimize unpreventable overdrafts. In this case, the commenter said that the Bureau also should allow prepaid account issuers to recoup no more than 5 percent of funds deposited each month until all debts caused by unpreventable overdrafts are paid.",
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Payment cushions.</em> One program manager also raised a concern about its de minimis purchase cushion, whereby it will authorize transactions for some consumers that result in a negative account balance so long as the shortfall is less than $10. For prepaid accounts where a per transaction fee is imposed on the prepaid account on all transactions regardless of whether the transaction is paid entirely with funds from the prepaid account or is paid with credit, a prepaid card would have been a credit card under the proposal unless the prepaid account issuer waived its per transaction fees on transactions that trigger the purchase cushion. This commenter said that it may not continue to offer its de minimis purchase cushion if it were required to waive these per transaction fees.",
                        "One consumer group commenter supported not triggering the credit card rules where a prepaid card can only access a de minimis amount of credit, using $10 as a safe harbor, if such credit is not promoted or disclosed.",
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Transactions that take the account negative when a load of funds from an asset account is pending.</em> One digital wallet provider raised concerns that a prepaid card could be subjected to the credit card rules under the proposal where credit could be extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account for transactions that occur after a consumer has requested a load transaction from another asset account to pay for the transaction but the load transaction has not yet settled. In this case, transactions on the prepaid account may take the account balance negative until the load transaction from the asset account has settled. This can occur, for example, when a consumer authorizes a remittance through a mobile wallet which is linked to a checking account, the consumer requests that funds be taken from the consumer's checking account to pay for the remittance, and the remittance is sent before the incoming transfer of funds from the checking account is complete. In this case, the prepaid account issuer is extending credit through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account until the incoming transfer of funds from the checking account is complete.",
                        "The commenter indicated that in all its multi-currency transactions, it charges a currency conversion fee for the transaction, including on transactions where credit is extended as described above. Nonetheless, this currency conversion fee for a credit transaction as described above is the same amount as the fee charged for transactions that are paid entirely with funds from the prepaid account. This commenter indicated that under the proposal, it would need to waive this currency conversion fee for transactions where credit is extended to prevent the prepaid card from becoming a credit card under the proposal, even though the currency conversion fee it charges for these transactions is the same amount as the current conversion fee it charges for transactions entirely paid from funds from the prepaid account. This commenter said that if a prepaid card would be a credit card in this scenario and it was required to waive these fees in order to avoid triggering the credit card rules, it would likely stop processing transactions that take the prepaid account negative (such as remittances discussed above) before the incoming transfer of funds from the checking account is complete."

                        "As discussed in more detail below in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2), new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii) defines the term \u201cnon-covered separate credit feature\u201d to mean a separate credit feature that does not meet the two conditions set forth in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i). A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a non-covered separate credit feature, even if the prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature as described in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i). A non-covered separate credit feature is not subject to the rules in Regulation Z applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards; however, it typically will be subject to Regulation Z depending on its own terms and conditions, independent of the connection to the prepaid account.",
                        "First, a separate credit feature is a \u201cnon-covered separate credit feature\u201d when the separate credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. This is true even if the separate credit feature functions as an overdraft credit feature with respect to the prepaid account. For example, if a consumer links her prepaid account to a credit card issued by a card issuer, where the card issuer is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner, and credit is drawn automatically into the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the prepaid card for which there are insufficient funds in the prepaid account, the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to the separate credit feature offered by the unrelated third party.",
                        "Second, a separate credit feature is a \u201cnon-covered separate credit feature\u201d if a prepaid card cannot access the separate credit feature during the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. This is true even if the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. For example, assume that a consumer can only conduct a draw or transfer of credit, or authorization of either, from a separate credit feature to a prepaid account at the prepaid account issuer's Web site, and these draws, transfers, or authorizations cannot occur in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction at the Web site to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.",
                        "For this type of \u201cnon-covered separate credit feature,\u201d the credit feature would not be functioning as an overdraft credit feature with respect to the prepaid account. In addition, the prepaid card also is not functioning as a traditional \u201cdual purpose\u201d card where the card can be used both to access the asset feature of a prepaid account and to draw on a credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers independent of whether there are sufficient or available funds in the asset feature to complete the transaction. Instead, the prepaid card can only be used to draw or transfer credit from a separate credit feature outside the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.",
                        "As described above, under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(1)(i) and final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i), a prepaid card is a credit card (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> a hybrid prepaid-credit card) for purposes of this regulation with respect to a covered separate credit feature. The Bureau is using its interpretive authority under TILA section 105(a) to define such prepaid cards as credit cards under TILA section 103(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>). The Bureau believes that defining such prepaid cards as credit cards under \u00a7 1026.2(a)(15)(i) is consistent with the definition of \u201ccredit card\u201d in TILA section 103(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>). TILA section 103(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>) defines the term \u201ccredit card\u201d to mean any card, plate, coupon book, or other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining money, property, labor, or services on credit.<footnote ref=\"697\">15 U.S.C. 1602(&lt;em data-original=\"E-03\"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;).</footnote>\n\n             The Bureau believes that such a prepaid card meets this TILA definition of \u201ccredit card\u201d because it can be used from time to time to obtain credit from the separate credit feature in the course of completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.",
                        "For the reasons set forth in the <em data-original=\"E-03\">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section, the Bureau believes that most overdraft credit features offered in connection with prepaid accounts should be treated as credit card accounts under Regulation Z, except in limited circumstances as discussed below and in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.61(a)(4). As discussed further below, however, the Bureau is concerned about covering prepaid cards as credit cards when the cards can access separate credit features offered by unrelated third parties that have no affiliation or business arrangement with the prepaid account issuer, even if the separate credit feature functions as an overdraft credit feature in relation to the prepaid account. In this case, the unrelated third party may not be aware when its credit feature is used as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account. If unrelated third parties were subject to the provisions applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards, these third parties would face additional compliance risk in connection with the prepaid card becoming a new access device for the credit account. The Bureau is concerned that such third parties might take steps to try to mitigate these kinds of risks, which would make prepaid accounts less widely usable by consumers. Thus, as discussed above and in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2) below, the final rule does not cover a prepaid card as a credit card under Regulation Z when it accesses separate credit features offered by these unrelated third parties. In order to facilitate compliance with TILA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its exception authority under TILA section 105(a) to exclude such prepaid cards from the definition of \u201ccredit card\u201d under TILA section 103(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>) and final Regulation Z \u00a7 1026.2(a)(15)(i). The exception would facilitate compliance by allowing an unrelated third party to comply with the rules in Regulation Z that already apply to the separate credit feature without having to comply with additional Regulation Z provisions that would apply if the prepaid card were covered as a credit card with respect to the credit feature. Under this exception, third parties would not face additional compliance risk in connection with the prepaid card becoming a new access device for the credit account, where the prepaid card may be linked to the separate credit feature without the knowledge of the unrelated third party.",
                        "As discussed above and in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) below, the Bureau also is clarifying that a prepaid card is not a credit card when the prepaid card accesses a separate credit feature that is not functioning as an overdraft credit feature, and the card is not a traditional \u201cdual purpose\u201d card as discussed above. In this case, the prepaid card only can access the separate credit feature outside the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Pursuant to its interpretive authority under TILA section 105(a), the Bureau is defining \u201ccredit card\u201d in current TILA section 103(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>) and final \u00a7 1026.2(a)(15)(i) to exclude a prepaid card from being covered as a credit card with respect to a separate credit feature when it only can access credit from the separate credit feature outside the course of completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The Bureau does not interpret TILA section 103(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>) to encompass an account number for a prepaid account to be a \u201ccredit card\u201d under TILA section 103(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>) when the prepaid account number can only be used as a destination for the transfer of money from a separate credit account, and cannot be used to obtain credit within the course of a transaction to obtain goods or service, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The Bureau believes that when credit is accessed outside of the course of a transaction on a prepaid account, it is somewhat less risky for consumers because consumers would be required to make a deliberate decision to access the credit outside the course of a transaction, and thus can separately evaluate the tradeoffs involved. In addition, as discussed further below, this approach is consistent with regard to how lines of credit that can be accessed by debit cards are treated under the credit card rules in Regulation Z. Thus, consistent with this current definition of \u201ccredit card,\u201d the Bureau is clarifying that a prepaid card is not a credit card with respect to a separate credit feature when it can only access the separate credit feature outside the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The Bureau also believes that this clarification is consistent with the proposal's general focus on covering overdraft credit features offered in connection with prepaid accounts as credit card accounts under Regulation Z.",

This provision is intended to trigger coverage under the credit card rules with respect to such overdraft credit features.

                        "However, as discussed further below, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b) prohibits a card issuer from structuring an overdraft credit feature as a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, unless the program is structured to involve only incidental credit as provided in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). The Bureau believes that this rule is necessary to promote transparency and compliance with the credit card requirements. Thus, under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b), a card issuer must structure an overdraft credit feature in connection with a prepaid account as a separate credit feature, such as a credit account or credit subaccount to the prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for overdraft credit features described in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). This separate credit feature is a \u201ccovered separate credit feature\u201d under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i).",
                        "As described in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) below, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) provides that an overdraft credit feature structured as a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account is not accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card where: (1) The prepaid card cannot access a covered separate credit feature as defined in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i); (2) with respect to the prepaid account accessible by the prepaid card, the prepaid account issuer generally has a policy and practice of declining to authorize transactions made with the card when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transactions, or the prepaid account issuer only authorizes those transactions in circumstances related to certain payment cushions and delayed load cushions; and (3) with respect to the prepaid account that is accessible by the prepaid card, the prepaid account issuer does not charge credit-related fees for any credit extended on the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law.",
                        "Under this exception, a prepaid account issuer may extend credit through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account in certain situations, such as force pay transactions, without having to waive general transaction fees, as would have been required under the proposal to avoid triggering the credit card rules. As discussed above, force pay transactions occur where the prepaid account issuer is required by card network rules to pay a transaction even though there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the transaction at settlement. This can occur, for example, where a transaction is either not authorized in advance, or where there were sufficient or available funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time the transaction is authorized, but there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature at the time the transaction is settled, and a negative balance results on the asset feature when the transaction is paid.",
                        "The exception in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) also would allow a prepaid account issuer to adopt a payment cushion where the issuer could authorize transactions that would take the account balance negative by no more than $10 at the time the transaction is authorized. In addition, the exception would allow a prepaid account issuer to adopt a delayed load cushion. Specifically, in cases where the prepaid account issuer has received an instruction or confirmation for an incoming EFT originated from a separate asset account to load funds to the prepaid account or where the prepaid account issuer has received a request from the consumer to load funds to the prepaid account from a separate asset account but in either case the funds from the separate asset account have not yet settled, the final rule allows a prepaid account issuer to authorize transactions that take the prepaid account negative, so long as the transactions will not cause the account balance to become negative at the time of the authorization by more than the incoming or requested load amount, as applicable.",
                        "Thus, the Bureau is intending to exempt overdraft credit features that are structured as a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account under Regulation Z where the prepaid account issuer generally is not authorizing transactions that will take the asset feature of the prepaid account negative and the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees on credit extended on the asset feature of the prepaid account. As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau believes that this exception will address a substantial number of the concerns expressed by industry commenters about situations in which the proposal would have required them to waive general transaction fees on incidental credit to avoid triggering the credit card rules. In light of the very limited nature of the incidental credit at issue, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to exclude this incidental credit from coverage under Regulation Z. Thus, to facilitate compliance with TILA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its exception authority under TILA section 105(a), to exclude such prepaid cards that qualify for the exception under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) from the definition of \u201ccredit card\u201d under TILA section 103(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>) and final Regulation Z \u00a7 1026.2(a)(15)(i).<footnote ref=\"699\">15 U.S.C. 1602(&lt;em data-original=\"E-03\"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;).</footnote>\n             The exception in new \u00a7 1026.61(a)(4) would facilitate compliance by allowing a prepaid account issuer to comply only with Regulation E with respect to the prepaid account and this incidental credit, instead of also complying with Regulation Z with respect to the incidental credit.",
                        "Given that a prepaid account issuer can only extend credit through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account in limited circumstances under the exception in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), and credit-related fees generally may not be imposed for the credit extended, the Bureau anticipates that the credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account that qualifies for the exception would be limited. The Bureau believes that certain harms to consumers, such as becoming overextended in using this credit, would be limited. Thus, to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes that this type of credit is more properly regulated under Regulation E as credit incidental to the prepaid card transaction. For example, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.12(a) above, Regulation E's provisions in final \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.11 and 1005.18(e) regarding error resolution would apply to extensions of this credit. In addition, such credit extensions would be disclosed on Regulation E periodic statements under existing \u00a7\u20091005.9(b) or, if the financial institution follows the periodic statement alternative in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1), on the electronic and written histories of the consumer's prepaid account transactions.",
                        "Also, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.17 above, although this incidental credit generally is governed by Regulation E, the Bureau is exempting this incidental credit from the opt-in rule in final \u00a7\u20091005.17. Existing \u00a7\u20091005.17 sets forth requirements that financial institutions must follow in order to provide \u201coverdraft services\u201d to consumers related to consumers' accounts. Under existing \u00a7\u20091005.17, financial institutions must provide consumers with notice of their right to opt-in, or affirmatively consent, to the institution's overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, and obtain the consumer's affirmative consent before fees or charges may be assessed on the consumer's account for paying such overdrafts. For the reasons discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.17 above, the Bureau is adding new \u00a7\u20091005.17(a)(4) to provide that credit accessed from an overdraft credit feature that is exempt from Regulation Z under \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) is not an overdraft service under final \u00a7\u20091005.17(a) and thus would not be subject to the opt-in requirements in final \u00a7\u20091005.17. This is true even though the prepaid account issuer may be charging per transaction fees that are permitted under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) with respect to credit accessed from the overdraft credit feature. The Bureau does not believe that the opt-in requirements in final \u00a7\u20091005.17 are appropriate for these types of overdraft credit features given that these overdraft credit features may not charge higher per transaction fees for credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account than the per transaction fees charged when the transaction only accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account.",

In proposing these provisions, the Bureau was concerned that a prepaid account issuer and a creditor could design arrangements to circumvent the proposed rules in Regulation Z applicable to prepaid cards that are credit cards. In this case, a third-party creditor could have an arrangement with the prepaid account issuer such that credit from the credit account is pushed from the credit account to the prepaid account during the course of a particular prepaid account transaction to prevent the transaction from taking the prepaid account balance negative. These provisions related to account numbers of the credit account were designed to prevent this type of evasion of the rules applicable to prepaid cards that are credit cards.",

The Bureau is not adopting such an anti-evasion rule at this time. The Bureau in various ways has crafted the final rule to address potential areas of evasion that could arise with respect to the application of the rules in Regulation Z to overdraft credit features offered by prepaid account issuers, their affiliates, or their business partners in connection with prepaid accounts. &lt;em data-original=\"E-03\"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; the section-by-section analyses of &amp;#167;\u00a7 1026.2(a)(7) and (a)(15)(i) and 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) above, and 1026.61(a)(4) and (a)(5)(iii) below.</footnote>\n             Specifically, new \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a \u201chybrid prepaid-credit card\u201d with respect to a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. New \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2)(i) defines such a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as a \u201ccovered separate credit feature.\u201d Thus, the hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature. In this case, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2) below, the final rule provides that a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to the covered separate credit feature regardless of whether (1) the credit is pushed from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature of the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) the credit is pulled from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature of the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.",

For the reasons set forth in the <em data-original=\"E-03\">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section, the Bureau believes that consumers will benefit from the application of the credit card rules generally to a credit account that functions as an overdraft credit feature in connection with a prepaid account when that overdraft feature is offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner, regardless of whether the credit account can only be used as an overdraft credit feature. In addition, the Bureau is concerned about potential evasion if the provisions set forth in the final rule applicable to overdraft credit features described above could be avoided simply by providing other uses for the credit account.",

As discussed above and in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) and (4) below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit.

For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the provisions in proposed \u00a7\u20091026.12(h) (renumbered as new \u00a7\u20091026.61(c)) related to these account numbers.</footnote>\n             Specifically, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(c)(1) provides that with respect to a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card at any point, a card issuer must not do any of the following until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered: (1) Open a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; (2) make a solicitation or provide an application to open a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; or (3) allow an existing credit feature that was opened prior to the consumer obtaining the prepaid account to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card.",

The beginning of the required 30-day timing requirement is triggered by successful completion of collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification, not by the consumer's mere purchase or obtaining of the card. New comment 61(c)-1 is revised from the proposal to provide guidance on situations where customer identification and verification are completed on a prepaid account before the account is opened. In that case, new comment 61(c)(1)-1 provides that the 30-day timing requirement begins on the day the prepaid account is opened.",
                        "The Bureau is moving proposed comment 12(h)-2 to new comment 61(c)-2 and is adopting it as proposed. The Bureau also is adding new comment 61(c)-3 to address situations where a hybrid prepaid-credit card is replaced or substituted for another hybrid prepaid-credit card. Specifically, new comment 61(c)-3 provides that a card issuer is not required to comply with new \u00a7\u20091026.61(c) when a hybrid prepaid-credit card is permitted to be replaced, or substituted, for another hybrid prepaid-credit card without a request or application under final \u00a7\u20091026.12(a)(2) and related commentary. For example, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(c) does not apply to situations where a prepaid account or credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is replaced because of security concerns, and a new hybrid prepaid-credit card is issued to access the new prepaid account or credit feature without a request or application under final \u00a7\u20091026.12(a)(2).",
                        "With regard to comments urging the Bureau to clarify that the 30-day restriction does not apply to a digital wallet's funding sources, the Bureau is adding new comment 61(a)(1)-4 to provide guidance on the circumstances in which a prepaid account number for a digital wallet that is a prepaid account is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a).",

                        "Thus, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(c) applies to a digital wallet that is capable of being loaded with funds (and thus is a prepaid account under final Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.2(b)(3)), where the prepaid account number that can access such a digital wallet is a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a). The Bureau believes that this additional guidance will help relieve any concerns that the 30-day period would effectively ban new consumers from linking a credit card as a funding source for their digital wallet, except where the linked credit feature is a covered separate credit feature as defined in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i).",
                        "With regard to the two conflicting sets of comments urging the Bureau to drop the 30-day waiting period entirely and conversely to expand it to 90 days, the Bureau has concluded based on additional consideration to adopt the 30-day waiting period as proposed. The Bureau continues to believe the 30-day waiting period would benefit consumers by separating the decisions to obtain and register the prepaid account from the decision to obtain a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card. Nonetheless, the Bureau believes that extending the waiting period to 90 days seems unnecessary to ensure that a consumer can make an informed decision regarding whether to link the account to a covered separate credit feature. The Bureau believes that a longer waiting period may restrict consumers who are seeking prepaid accounts with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.",
                        "The Bureau notes that if the prepaid account issuer offers the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card, the prepaid account issuer is the \u201ccard issuer\u201d for purposes of Regulation Z, including new \u00a7\u20091026.61(c). This is because the hybrid prepaid-credit card accessing the covered separate credit feature is a credit card, and existing \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(7) defines \u201ccard issuer\u201d as a person that issues a credit card or that person's agent with respect to the card. If the prepaid account issuer's affiliate or business partner offers the covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, both the person offering the covered separate credit feature and the prepaid account issuer are card issuers for purposes of new \u00a7\u20091026.61(c). In this case, under new comment 2(a)(7)-1.ii, the person offering the covered separate credit feature would be an agent of the prepaid account issuer.",
                        "The Bureau believes that use of its authority under TILA section 105(a) to add the provisions in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(c) is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA to help ensure the informed use of the credit or charge card account when it is opened. Specifically, TILA section 102 provides that one of the main purposes of TILA is to promote the informed use of credit by ensuring meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that consumers will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available and avoid the uninformed use of credit.<footnote ref=\"715\">15 U.S.C. 1601.</footnote>\n             Furthermore, TILA section 132 requires that no credit card shall be issued except in response to a request or application therefor.<footnote ref=\"716\">15 U.S.C. 1642.</footnote>\n             In addition, the Bureau believes that the waiting period will, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a), ensure that the features of the covered separate credit feature offered in connection with the prepaid account are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits the consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the credit feature.",
                        "The Bureau believes that the requirement in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(c) of a 30-day waiting period for a prepaid card to access a covered separate credit feature will promote the informed and voluntary use of credit. Under new \u00a7\u20091026.12(c)(1), a card issuer must not do any of the following until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered: (1) Open a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; (2) make a solicitation or provide an application to open a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; or (3) allow an existing credit feature that was opened prior to the consumer obtaining the prepaid account to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card. The Bureau believes that it would promote the informed use of the credit to separate the decision to purchase and register a prepaid account from the decision to accept an offer to add a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. The Bureau believes that consumers may be able to focus more effectively on the credit terms of the covered separate credit feature, and make a more informed decision whether to request such a credit feature, if the decision to accept the credit feature occurs apart from the process to register the card. Without these protections, card issuers may attempt to market the covered separate credit feature to prepaid cardholders at the time they purchase the prepaid card or at registration. The Bureau believes that without this provision, prepaid account issuers would be likely to provide solicitations or applications to the prepaid cardholder to open a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, or suggest that the prepaid cardholder allow an existing credit feature held by the prepaid cardholder to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, at the time the prepaid accounts are registered because prepaid account issuers will already be collecting information from the cardholders in order to register the prepaid accounts.",
                        "Without the waiting period, consumers may feel pressured to decide whether to add the covered separate credit feature without having the opportunity to fully consider the terms of the credit feature and the consequences of obtaining the credit feature. Therefore, the Bureau believes that a consumer's decision to add a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card to the prepaid account should be distinct from the decision to obtain or register the prepaid card.",
                        "In addition, the Bureau believes that separating these decisions would better allow consumers to focus on the terms and conditions that apply to the prepaid account at the time of purchase and registration, which may enable the consumer to better understand those terms and conditions. This is consistent with EFTA section 905(a), which requires financial institutions to disclose the terms and conditions of EFTs involving a consumer's account. The Bureau also believes that requiring at least 30 days to elapse between the registration of a prepaid account and any offer of a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card would enhance consumer understanding of the terms of the prepaid account and would help consumers to make more informed decisions regarding linking a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card to the prepaid account.",
                        "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) above, existing customer identification requirements limit the functionality of most prepaid accounts prior to registration. In addition, the registration process is critical for application of full Regulation E protections under this final rule. For example, Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.18(e)(3) provides that for all prepaid accounts, other than payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts, with respect to which the financial institution has not completed its identification and verification process (or for which the financial institution has no process), the financial institution is not required to provisionally credit the consumer's account in the event the financial institution takes longer than 10 or 20 business days, as applicable, to investigate and determine whether an error occurred.<footnote ref=\"717\">See also new Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(2), which provides a modified version of the periodic statement alternative for prepaid accounts that cannot be or have not been verified by the financial institution.</footnote>\n             If a card issuer were allowed to market covered separate credit features to consumers at the time of prepaid account registration, the Bureau is concerned that that consumers could believe that they are required to request that the covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card be linked to the prepaid account in order to register or access the prepaid account. This could cause some consumers to not register their prepaid accounts and lose important protections under Regulation E."

While a negative balance structure would be permissible where an issuer only offers incidental credit pursuant to new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4),<footnote ref=\"707\">If a prepaid account issuer complies with the exception in \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) with respect to a prepaid account that is accessed by a prepaid card, the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under Regulation Z, and thus is not a credit card under Regulation Z. The prepaid account issuer is not a card issuer under \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(7) and thus, \u00a7\u20091026.61(b) does not apply to the overdraft credit feature accessed by the prepaid card.</footnote>\n             an issuer that offers more extensive credit or charges credit-related fees using a negative balance structure would be subject to the credit card rules, pursuant to new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(3), and would be in violation of the rule on account structure specified in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b). Instead, under the final rule, a card issuer must structure the credit feature as a separate credit feature, either as a separate credit account, or as a credit subaccount of a prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account. The separate credit feature is a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i).",
                        "The Bureau believes that this structural requirement will make it substantially easier for creditors and consumers alike to implement and understand credit accessible via a hybrid prepaid-credit card under a credit card regime. Regulation Z's open-end rules are generally drafted with the assumption that the product in question is a pure credit product, without substantial positive funds. For example, existing \u00a7\u20091026.11(a) generally provides that creditors must refund any positive balances on the credit account to the consumer within six months. And, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.4(a) above, the rules for defining finance charges in the credit card context generally treat all transaction charges as finance charges, which makes sense when all transactions are generally assumed to involve use of credit.",
                        "But because hybrid prepaid-credit cards by their nature involve consumer assets as well as use of credit, bifurcating the asset feature from the credit feature makes application of the credit card rules more intuitive in a number of respects. For example, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) above, it provides a structure by which general transaction fees that are imposed in the same amount for any transaction conducted on the prepaid account\u2014regardless of whether there are sufficient positive funds in the account\u2014to be excluded from the finance charge. This both makes the program easier for the prepaid account issuer to operate and easier for the consumer to understand, so that the finance charge reflects the costs associated with the use of credit. As discussed above, this implementation is also more generally consistent with comments received in response to the proposed rule that urged the Bureau to include only differentiated and unique fees imposed when credit is extended in the definition of finance charge, rather than also including fees that are the same for purely positive balance transactions.",
                        "Bifurcating the two features also will make it easier to apply standard credit card requirements, such as periodic statements requirements and no-offset rules in the prepaid context. Specifically, the periodic statement requirements in \u00a7\u20091026.7(b)(1) and (10) (which implement TILA section 127(b)(1) and (8) respectively) require card issuers to disclose for each billing cycle both the outstanding balance in the account at the beginning of statement period and the outstanding balance in the account at the end of the period.<footnote ref=\"708\">15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(1) and (8).</footnote>\n             In addition, because of the offset restrictions in final \u00a7\u20091026.12(d) (which implements TILA section 169)\u2009<footnote ref=\"709\">15 U.S.C. 1666h(a).</footnote>\n             and the due date and 21-day timing requirements for periodic statements in final \u00a7\u20091026.7(b)(11)and in final \u00a7\u20091026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) (which implement TILA sections 127(b)(12) and (o) and TILA section 163 respectively),<footnote ref=\"710\">15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(12), and (o) and 1666b.</footnote>\n             incoming deposits to the asset feature of the prepaid account could not be applied automatically to repay the negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account when those incoming deposits are received. Instead, with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit card, a card issuer (1) is required to adopt reasonable procedures designed to ensure that periodic statements for the covered separate credit features are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the periodic statement, and the due date disclosed must be the same day of the month for each billing cycle; and (2) can move funds automatically from the asset account held by the card issuer to the covered separate credit feature held by the card issuer to pay some or all of the credit card debt on the covered separate credit feature no more frequently than once per month, such as on the payment due date (pursuant to the consumer's signed, written agreement that the issuer may do so). Even if card issuers were able to identify methods of satisfying those requirements that were technically compliant with the credit card rules using a negative balance account structure, the Bureau believes that consumers would have a harder time understanding the operation of their accounts and their rights under such a system.",
                        "Accordingly, the Bureau believes that use of its authority under TILA section 105(a) to add the provisions in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b) is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA to help ensure the informed use of the credit or charge card account. Specifically, TILA section 102 provides that one of the main purposes of TILA is to promote the informed use of credit by ensuring meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that consumers will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available and avoid the uninformed use of credit.<footnote ref=\"711\">15 U.S.C. 1601.</footnote>\n             The Bureau believes that requiring credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards to be structured as separate credit features will promote the purposes of TILA by ensuring that Regulation Z's periodic statement disclosures are clear to consumers and that card issuers are complying with the offset restrictions and due date requirements in TILA in a manner that is transparent to consumers.",
                        "The Bureau recognizes under this requirement, card issuers will be required after the final rule becomes effective to structure any overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner as a separate credit feature, except to the extent that overdraft credit feature meets the conditions set forth in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). To the extent a prepaid account issuer has been offering overdraft credit as a negative balance on prepaid accounts prior to these rules becoming effective, the prepaid account issuer will need to restructure its overdraft credit feature as a separate credit feature if the overdraft credit feature does not meet the conditions set forth in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). Nonetheless, as discussed above, the Bureau believes that bifurcating the two accounts is likely to make it easier for card issuers to comply with the Regulation Z requirements, such as the periodic statement and offset provisions discussed above, that will apply to the overdraft credit feature once the final rule becomes effective and facilitate consumers' understanding of the operation of their accounts and their rights with respect to each account.",
                        "To provide additional clarity on the provisions in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b), new comment 61(b)-1 provides that if a credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is structured as a subaccount of the prepaid account, the credit feature must be set up as a separate balance on the prepaid account such that there are at least two balances on the prepaid account\u2014the asset account balance and the credit account balance.",
                        "New comment 61(b)-2 provides guidance on how a card issuer may comply with the requirement in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b). New comment 61(b)-2.i provides that if at the time a prepaid card transaction is initiated there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to complete the transaction, credit must be drawn, transferred, or authorized to be drawn or transferred from the covered separate credit feature at the time the transaction is authorized. The card issuer may not allow the asset feature on the prepaid account to become negative and draw or transfer the credit from the covered separate credit feature at a later time, such as at the end of the day. The card issuer must comply with the applicable provisions of this regulation with respect to the credit extension from the time the prepaid card transaction is authorized. Because of the offset prohibition set forth in final \u00a7\u20091026.12(d) and the due date and 21-day timing requirements for periodic statements in final \u00a7\u20091026.7(b)(11) and in final \u00a7\u20091026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) respectively, incoming deposits to the asset feature of the prepaid account could not be applied automatically to repay the negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account when those incoming deposits are received. Thus, new comment 61(b)-2.i makes clear that a card issuer may not allow the asset feature on the prepaid account to become negative and draw or transfer the credit from the covered separate credit feature at a later time, such as at the end of the day, to ensure that the card issuer is complying with these Regulation Z provisions in a manner that is clear to consumers.",
                        "New comment 61(b)-2.ii provides that for transactions where there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the transaction at the time it settles, and the prepaid transaction either was not authorized in advance or the transaction was authorized and there were sufficient or available funds in the prepaid account at the time of authorization to cover the transaction, credit must be drawn from the covered separate credit feature to settle these transactions. The card issuer may not allow the asset feature on the prepaid account to become negative. The card issuer must comply with the applicable provisions of this regulation from the time the transaction is settled.",
                        "New comment 61(b)-2.iii provides that if a negative balance would result on the asset feature in circumstances other than those described in new comment 61(b)-2.i and ii, credit must be drawn from the covered separate credit feature to avoid the negative balance. The card issuer may not allow the asset feature on the prepaid account to become negative. The card issuer must comply with the applicable provisions in this regulation from the time credit is drawn from the covered separate credit feature. For example, assume that a fee for an ATM balance inquiry is imposed on the prepaid account when there are insufficient or unavailable funds to cover the amount of the fee when it is imposed. Credit must be drawn from the covered separate credit feature to avoid a negative balance. The Bureau expects that the card issuer will make it clear to consumers in the credit arrangement that credit will be drawn from the covered separate credit feature to avoid a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, including if applicable for fees imposed on the prepaid account where there are insufficient or unavailable funds to cover the amount of the fee when it is imposed."

The final rule also adds a new example in final comment 12(a)(1)-2.ii to provide that issuance of a credit card includes allowing a prepaid card to access a covered separate credit feature that would make the card into a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new \u00a7\u20091026.61 with respect to the covered separate credit feature. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61 and a credit card under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature."

Under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i)(A), a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature (and the separate credit feature is a covered separate credit feature) when it is a single device that can be used from time to time to access the separate credit feature where the following two conditions are both satisfied: (1) The card can draw, transfer, or authorize the draw or transfer of credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner.

As discussed above, under the proposal, a prepaid card would not have been a credit card under \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) if the prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in \u00a7\u20091026.4, or fee described in \u00a7\u20091026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. One consumer group commenter expressed concern that the exclusion of prepaid cards from the definition of credit card if the prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to a finance charge, as defined in \u00a7\u20091026.4, or a fee described \u00a7\u20091026.4(c) would lead to evasions.

This commenter urged the Bureau to cover all prepaid cards as a credit card when the prepaid card accesses credit, regardless of whether a finance charge or a fee described under \u00a7\u20091026.4(c) is imposed for the credit.

In the proposal, the Bureau stated its belief that this type of credit, where no credit-related fees are imposed, is more properly regulated under Regulation E as credit incidental to the prepaid card transaction. See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) below for a description of the exception that is contained in the final rule.",
                        "With regard to covered separate credit features, however, the same logic does not apply. Not all credit extensions accessing separate credit features via a prepaid card would be subject to Regulation E protections if Regulation Z did not apply. Rather, Regulation E would apply to credit extensions that are deposited in a prepaid account by use of an EFT, but it would not apply to extensions of credit where the transaction does not involve an EFT to or from the prepaid account. The final rule also is consistent with the definition of \u201ccredit card\u201d under Regulation Z, which does not require that finance charges be charged for the credit in order for a device to meet the definition of \u201ccredit card.\u201d",

In developing these rules, the Bureau was conscious that there were two distinct types of credit extensions that could occur with respect to a covered separate credit feature. The first type of credit extension is where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The second type of credit extension is where a consumer makes a standalone draw or transfer of credit from the covered separate credit feature, outside the course of any transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. For example, a consumer may use the prepaid card at the prepaid account issuer's Web site to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.

This provision prevents a prepaid account issuer from evading the credit card provisions of Regulation Z by structuring the transactions as a push of credit funds to the prepaid account (as opposed to a pull of credit funds from the separate credit feature) during the course of a particular prepaid account transaction to prevent the transaction from taking the prepaid account balance negative.",

For example, if the non-covered separate credit feature is an open-end credit card account offered by an unrelated third-party creditor that is not an affiliate or business partner of the prepaid account issuer, the person already will be a card issuer under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(7) and thus a creditor under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(17)(iii). Nonetheless, in that case, the person does not need to comply with the provisions in Regulation Z applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards even though the prepaid card can access credit from the non-covered separate credit feature. The obligations under Regulation Z that apply to a non-covered separate credit feature are not affected by the fact that the prepaid card can access credit from the non-covered separate credit feature.",
                        "Each of the two types of non-covered separate credit features is discussed in more detail below.",

These commenters were concerned that an unrelated third party may not be aware when its credit feature is used as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account. If unrelated third parties that offer separate credit features were subject to the provisions applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards, these third parties would face additional compliance risk in connection with the prepaid card becoming a new access device for the credit account. This would have been true even if the third parties were already subject to the credit card rules in their own right because the proposal contained a number of provisions that would have applied only to prepaid cards that are credit cards and would not have applied to credit card accounts generally.",
                        "In contrast, several consumer groups supported the proposed rule to consider a third party that offers an open-end credit feature accessed by a prepaid card to be an agent of the prepaid account issuer and thus a credit card issuer with responsibilities under Regulation Z.",
                        "Based on the comments, the Bureau believes it is appropriate not to trigger status as a hybrid prepaid-credit card where a credit feature is not offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner, even if an individual consumer decides to link the two accounts such that a draw or transfer of credit, or authorization of either, occurs during the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.",
                        "With respect to a third party offering a separate credit feature that is neither an affiliate nor a business partner of the prepaid account issuer, the Bureau recognizes that this unrelated third party may not be aware when its credit feature is used as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account. If unrelated third parties were subject to the provisions applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards, such third parties would face additional compliance risk in connection with the prepaid card becoming a new access device for the credit account. This can occur when the prepaid account issuer uses the ACH network to execute an authorization from a consumer to pull credit for a consumer from a separate credit account offered by an unrelated third party. Financial institutions participating in the ACH network may have difficulty specifically identifying and blocking pulls of credit by a prepaid account (and, unlike with credit/debit cards, the prepaid account issuer likely would have no way of knowing if the account and routing number a consumer provides for ACH purposes accesses a deposit account or a credit account). Moreover, because an ACH debit pull may be used to access credit from accounts that are not subject to the current credit card rules in their own right, the Bureau is concerned that unrelated third parties offering separate credit features would face even more challenges if the pull (or the ability to initiate pulls) triggered credit card compliance obligations.",
                        "The Bureau also is concerned that unrelated third parties that are already subject to the credit card rules in their own right also may be unwilling to assume that compliance risk due to the prepaid account issuer's actions in linking a separate credit feature offered by an unrelated third party to a prepaid account to be used as an overdraft credit feature. As a result, the Bureau is concerned that credit card networks could prevent prepaid account issuers from being merchants in the network for all purposes because credit card issuers would not want to be subject to the enhanced obligations in Regulation Z that would apply if a prepaid card were deemed to be a credit card with respect to a credit card account offered by an unrelated third party. The Bureau believes that this rule will reduce the risk that unrelated third parties offering separate credit features would take the steps described above, which could harm consumers by making prepaid accounts less widely usable by consumers.",
                        "Thus, the final rule does not consider a prepaid card to be a credit card under the regulation in relation to a separate credit feature where an unrelated third party that is not an affiliate or business partner of the prepaid account issuer offers the credit feature.",
                        "In contrast, the Bureau does believe that it is appropriate to consider a prepaid card to be a credit card when it can access an overdraft credit feature that is offered by a third party where the third party is the prepaid account issuer's affiliate or its business partner. As discussed further below in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(5), new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(5)(i) defines the term \u201caffiliate\u201d for purposes of \u00a7\u20091026.61 and other provisions in Regulation Z related to hybrid prepaid-credit cards to mean any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another company, as set forth in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841 <em data-original=\"E-03\">et seq.</em>).",
                        "As discussed further below in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(5), new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(5)(iii) defines the term \u201cbusiness partner\u201d for purposes of \u00a7\u20091026.61 and other provisions in Regulation Z related to hybrid prepaid-credit cards generally to mean a person (other than the prepaid account issuer or its affiliates) that can extend credit through a separate credit feature where either (1) the person that can extend credit or its affiliate has an agreement with the prepaid account issuer or its affiliate that the prepaid card can access the separate credit feature in the course of a transaction; or (2) the person that can extend credit or its affiliate has a cross-marketing agreement or other similar arrangement with the prepaid account issuer or its affiliate and where, whether or not by agreement, the prepaid card can access the separate credit feature in the course of a transaction.",
                        "The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to consider such an unaffiliated third party that can extend credit to be the prepaid account issuer's business partner in the above circumstances because in those cases, there is a sufficient connection between the parties such that the unaffiliated third party should know that its credit feature is accessible by a prepaid card as a credit feature for the prepaid account. Also, the Bureau believes that these types of links between the prepaid account issuer and the unaffiliated third party are likely to involve revenue sharing or payments between the two companies and the pricing structure of the two accounts may be related. Thus, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to consider these entities to be business partners in this context.",
                        "The Bureau believes that the approach described above of not covering a prepaid card as a credit card with respect to a separate credit feature when it is offered by a third party that is not an affiliate or business partner of the prepaid account issuer addresses the concerns discussed above about unintended consequences for consumers and third parties alike, while appropriately guarding against the risk that third parties offering separate credit features or their affiliates would cooperate with prepaid account issuers or their affiliates to attempt to evade the intended scope of the rules regarding overdraft credit features.",
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Non-covered separate credit feature where prepaid card can access separate credit feature only outside the course of a transaction.</em> One issuing credit union expressed concerned that the proposal would have triggered the credit card rules in situations in which a prepaid card could be used only to complete standalone loads or transfers of credit from a separate credit feature to the prepaid account, but not to access credit in the course of a transaction conducted with the prepaid card. This commenter noted that consumers can consciously load value to their prepaid account using their debit card or credit card, where the load is not part of an overdraft feature offered in connection with the prepaid account. When using the debit card, the consumer may consciously load funds from an overdraft or line of credit product that is linked to a traditional checking account. When using a credit card, the consumer is loading from an available credit card balance to fund the prepaid account. This commenter urged the Bureau to clarify that such loads do not make the prepaid card into a credit card under Regulation Z.",
                        "Several consumer group commenters suggested that the credit card rules should apply to a credit account even if the credit account did not function as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account, so long as credit from the credit account was deposited into the prepaid account. These consumer group commenters indicated that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all credit transferred to a prepaid account, even if there is another way to access the credit.",
                        "Another consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all open-end lines of credit where credit may be deposited or transferred to prepaid accounts if either (1) the creditor is the same institution as or has a business relationship with the prepaid issuer; or (2) the creditor reasonably anticipates that a prepaid card will be used as an access device for the line of credit. Nonetheless, this commenter said that the final rule should not impact a completely unrelated credit account that has no connection to prepaid issuers or consumers identified as prepaid card users, even though the creditor allows credit to be transferred from the credit account through the ACH system.",
                        "In the final rule, the Bureau is clarifying the circumstances in which a prepaid card is a credit card from the proposal to address circumstances in which credit can only be loaded or transferred from a separate credit feature to the prepaid account outside the course of completing a transaction conducted with the prepaid card. Under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii), even if a separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner, a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) with respect to that separate credit feature if the feature cannot be accessed within the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. For example, assume that a consumer can only conduct a draw or transfer of credit, or authorization of either, from a separate credit feature to a prepaid account at the prepaid account issuer's Web site, and these draws, transfers, or authorizations of either, cannot occur in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions at the Web site to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. In this case, the separate credit feature is a non-covered separate credit feature under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii), and the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) with respect to this non-covered separate credit feature.",
                        "With respect to this type of non-covered separate credit feature, the separate credit feature cannot function as an overdraft credit feature with respect to the prepaid account. In addition, the prepaid card also cannot function as a traditional \u201cdual purpose\u201d card where the card can be used both to access the asset feature of a prepaid account and to draw on the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers independent of whether there are sufficient or available funds in the asset feature to complete the transaction. Instead, the prepaid card can only be used to draw or transfer credit from the separate credit feature on an occasional and intentional basis, outside the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The Bureau believes that this situation is somewhat less risky for consumers because consumers would be required to make a deliberate decision to access the credit outside the course of a transaction, and thus can separately evaluate the tradeoffs involved. The Bureau also believes that this clarification is consistent with the proposal's general focus on covering overdraft credit features offered in connection with prepaid accounts as credit card accounts under Regulation Z.",
                        "In addition, in adopting this approach, the Bureau is drawing on the same logic and maintaining consistency with the existing credit card rules' treatment of overdraft lines of credit that can be accessed by debit cards. Under the existing rules as set forth in existing comments 2(a)(15)-2.i.B and 2(a)(15)-2.ii.A., debit cards are generally treated as credit cards under existing \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) when they access overdraft lines of credit (where there is an agreement to extend credit). In addition, the term \u201ccredit card\u201d also includes a deposit account number even when there is no physical debit card device when the account number can be used to access an open-end line of credit to purchase goods or services. Nonetheless, under the current definition of credit card as set forth in existing comment 2(a)(15)(i)-2.ii.C, a deposit account number is not a credit card if the account number can only be used as a destination for the transfer of money from a separate credit account."

                        "In response to the comment, the Bureau is revising existing \u00a7\u20091026.60(b) to provide that with respect to a covered separate credit feature that is a charge card account accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new \u00a7\u20091026.61, a charge card issuer also must provide the above three disclosures. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under \u00a7\u20091026.61 and a credit card under \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",
                        "TILA section 127(c)(5) states that the Bureau may, by regulation, require the disclosure of information in addition to that otherwise required by 127(c), and modify any disclosure of information required by 127(c), in any application or solicitation to open a charge card account for any person, if the Bureau determines that such action is necessary to carry out the purposes of, or prevent evasions of, any paragraph of this subsection. The Bureau believes that use of its authority under TILA section 105(a) and 127(c)(5) to amend \u00a7\u20091026.60(b) to require such charge card issuers to provide these three disclosures is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA to help ensure the informed use of covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are charge cards. Specifically, TILA section 102 provides that one of the main purposes of TILA is to promote the informed use of credit by ensuring meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that consumers will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available and avoid the uninformed use of credit.<footnote ref=\"692\">15 U.S.C. 1601.</footnote>\n             In addition, the Bureau believes that requiring these three disclosures for covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are charge cards will, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a), ensure that the terms of these charge card accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the charge card account.",
                        "The Bureau believes that these disclosures may be more helpful for covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are charge cards than they would be for traditional charge card accounts. Traditional charge card accounts typically require charge cardholders to repay the charge card balance in full each month. Thus, the required credit insurance, debt cancellation, or debt suspension disclosures typically would not apply to these accounts because the cardholders are not allowed to revolve charge card balances. In addition, traditional charge card accounts are generally targeted to more creditworthy individuals. Thus, these charge cards typically have a higher credit limit and typically do not charge fees for credit availability that exceed 15 percent of the initial credit line. Traditional charge card issuers also typically do not impose fixed finance charges.",
                        "Nonetheless, the Bureau believes that covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are charge cards may more likely be targeted to consumers with lower credit scores than credit card users overall and the card issuer may not require that charge card balances be repaid in full each month. Thus, in these cases, charge card issuers may be more likely to charge fixed finance charges; require credit insurance, debt cancellation, or debt suspension products; or charge fees for credit availability that might exceed the 15 percent threshold. Thus, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to apply these disclosures when a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card that is a charge card is opened."

In this case, the $0.75 excess is a charge imposed as part of the plan under final \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3) and must be disclosed under final \u00a7\u20091026.60(b)(4).",

                        "One industry trade association commenter indicated that it would be inappropriate to treat the line of credit (or its associated account number) as a credit card when the consumer has the choice of whether to use the line of credit to cover specified overdrafts or to use the line of credit funds for other purposes. This commenter believed that the consumer's ability to choose how to use the line of credit makes it clear that the line of credit is a general use line of credit and not a substitute for an overdraft line of credit.",
                        "<em data-original=\"E-03\">The final rule.</em> Upon review of the comments and its own analysis, the Bureau has decided not to adopt the proposal to provide that an account number for a credit account would be a credit card where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. In proposing these provisions, the Bureau was concerned that a prepaid account issuer and a creditor could design arrangements to circumvent the proposed rules in Regulation Z applicable to prepaid cards that are credit cards. In this case, a third-party creditor could have an arrangement with the prepaid account issuer such that credit from the credit account is pushed from the credit account to the prepaid account during the course of a particular prepaid account transaction to prevent the transaction from taking the prepaid account balance negative. These provisions related to credit account numbers were designed to prevent this type of evasion.",
                        "The Bureau is addressing this type of evasion by generally covering a prepaid card as a credit card (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> \u201chybrid prepaid-credits card\u201d) when the card can access a separate credit feature that functions as an overdraft credit feature and is offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Specifically, new \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a \u201chybrid prepaid-credit card\u201d with respect to a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. New \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2)(i) defines such a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as a \u201ccovered separate credit feature.\u201d Thus, the hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature. In this case, as described in new comment 61(a)(2)-1.ii, the prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to the covered separate credit feature regardless of whether (1) the credit is pushed from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature of the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) the credit is pulled from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature of the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.",
                        "In addition, as described in new comment 61(a)(2)-1.iii, a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature, as discussed above, regardless of whether the covered separate credit feature can only be used as an overdraft credit feature, solely accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card, or whether it is a general line of credit that can be accessed in other ways. For the reasons set forth in the <em data-original=\"E-03\">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section, the Bureau believes that consumers will benefit from the application of the credit card rules generally to a credit account that functions as an overdraft credit feature in connection with a prepaid account when that overdraft feature is offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner, regardless of whether the credit account can be used exclusively as an overdraft credit feature. In addition, the Bureau is concerned about potential evasion if the provisions applicable to overdraft credit features could be avoided simply by providing other uses for the credit account.",
                        "The Bureau believes that the provisions in the final rule described above with respect to a covered separate credit feature adequately capture situations where a separate credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner functions as an overdraft credit feature in relation to a prepaid account. Thus, the Bureau believes that it is no longer necessary to treat a credit account number as a credit card to capture situations when the credit account may function as an overdraft credit feature in relation to the prepaid account. As a result, the Bureau has not adopted proposed \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(vii) and proposed comments 2(a)(15)-2.i.G and 2(a)(15)-5.

These consumer group commenters indicated that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all credit transferred to a prepaid account, even if there is another way to access the credit. Another consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all open-end lines of credit where credit is deposited or transferred to prepaid accounts if either (1) the creditor is the same institution, as or has a business relationship with, the prepaid issuer; or (2) the creditor reasonably anticipates that a prepaid card will be used as an access device for the line of credit.",
                        "As discussed above and in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61 below, the Bureau generally intends to cover under Regulation Z overdraft credit features in connection with prepaid accounts where the credit features are offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or its business partners. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61 below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a \u201cnon-covered separate credit feature,\u201d which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers, or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Second, under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61 or a credit card under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features.

The existing comment further clarifies that for example, \u00a7\u20091026.52(a) applies to: (1) Fees that the consumer is required to pay for the issuance or availability of credit described in \u00a7\u20091026.60(b)(2), including any fee based on account activity or inactivity and any fee that a consumer is required to pay in order to receive a particular credit limit; (2) fees for insurance described in \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(7) or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage described in \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(10) written in connection with a credit transaction, if the insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage is required by the terms of the account; (3) fees that the consumer is required to pay in order to engage in transactions using the account (such as cash advance fees, balance transfer fees, foreign transaction fees, and fees for using the account for purchases); (4) fees that the consumer is required to pay for violating the terms of the account (except to the extent specifically excluded by existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(a)(2)(i)); (5) fixed finance charges; and (6) minimum charges imposed if a charge would otherwise have been determined by applying a periodic interest rate to a balance except for the fact that such charge is smaller than the minimum."

New comment 52(a)(2)-2 provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new \u00a7 1026.61 where the credit feature is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, final \u00a7 1026.52(a) applies to the following fees: (1) Except as provided in \u00a7 1026.52(a)(2), any fee or charge imposed on the covered separate credit feature, other than a charge attributable to a periodic interest rate, during the first year after account opening that the card issuer will or may require the consumer to pay in connection with the credit feature; and (2) except as provided in existing \u00a7 1026.52(a)(2), any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account (other than a charge attributable to a periodic interest rate) during the first year after account opening that the card issuer will or may require the consumer to pay where that fee or charge is a charge imposed as part of the plan under final \u00a7 1026.6(b)(3). As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new \u00a7 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7 1026.61 and a credit card under final \u00a7 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",
                        "As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.6 above, with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is a \u201ccharge imposed as part of the plan\u201d under final \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3) to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. This fee or charge also is a finance charge under new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii).",
                        "The Bureau believes that the restriction on fees set forth in TILA section 127(n)(1), as implemented in existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(a), provides important protections for consumers, particularly in the context of covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. As discussed above, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii) includes an overdraft credit feature offered by prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in connection with a prepaid account. In this case, the covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is designed to provide liquidity to the prepaid account. As discussed above, except as provided in existing \u00a7\u20091026.52(a)(2), with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new \u00a7\u20091026.61, the restriction in final \u00a7\u20091026.52(a) applies to fees or charges imposed on the covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as well as fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account when those fees are \u201ccharges imposed as part of the plan\u201d under final \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3).",
                        "Although the Bureau believes that issuers will generally assess credit-related fees on the covered separate credit feature, TILA section 127(n)(1) applies to \u201cany fees,\u201d with some exceptions, that the consumer is required to pay under the terms of a credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan. That term readily encompasses credit-related fees that are imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account because it speaks to what the fees relate to, not where they are placed. Even if the term were ambiguous, the Bureau believes\u2014based on its expertise and experience with respect to credit card markets\u2014that interpreting it to encompass credit-related fees imposed on the asset feature would promote the purposes of TILA to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices. The Bureau believes that from the consumer's perspective, there is no practical difference between a fee charged against the covered separate credit feature and a credit-related fee charged to the asset feature of the prepaid account in order to access credit because both functionally reduce the total amount of credit available to the consumer through the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card until such fees are paid. If TILA section 127(n)(1) were not interpreted to include credit-related fees charged across any linked accounts, the Bureau is concerned that card issuers could hide non-exempt fees by imposing them on the asset feature of the prepaid account or by creating separate artificially distinct credit accounts and attempting to collect the non-exempt fees from those linked credit accounts.",
                        "The Bureau also is adding new comment 52(a)(2)-3 to provide that final \u00a7\u20091026.52(a) does not apply to any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under new \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) with respect to the covered separate credit feature. The Bureau notes that under new \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1, with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new \u00a7\u20091026.61, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is not a \u201ccharge imposed as part of the plan\u201d with respect to the covered separate credit feature to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge does not exceed comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. As described in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii), these fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges under new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii). As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.4 and 1026.6 above, the Bureau believes that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account that are not finance charges (and thus, not charges imposed as part of the plan under new \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D)) with respect to the covered separate credit feature are more appropriately regulated under Regulation E, rather than regulated under Regulation Z, with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",

To the extent that a load fee or transfer fee that is imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account is a finance charge under new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii), that load or transfer fee is subject to the 25 percent restriction under \u00a7\u20091026.52(a) because those fees would be \u201ccharges imposed as part of the plan\u201d under final \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3).",

As described in new \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a non-covered separate credit feature is not subject to the rules applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards; however, it typically will be subject to Regulation Z depending on its own terms and conditions, independent of the connection to the prepaid account. Thus, a non-covered separate credit feature may be subject to the provisions in \u00a7 1026.52(a) in its own right.",

                        "To prevent evasion of the protections provided in the final rule related to hybrid prepaid-credit cards, the Bureau believes that it is important to include an unaffiliated third party that can extend credit through a separate credit feature as a \u201cbusiness partner\u201d of the prepaid account issuer where the person that can extend credit, or its affiliate, has a marketing agreement or arrangement with the prepaid account issuer, or its affiliate, and where, whether or not by agreement, the prepaid card can access the separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. Otherwise, the Bureau is concerned that without including such arrangements, prepaid account issuers or their affiliates could structure an arrangement with an unaffiliated third party that can extend credit, or its affiliate, to avoid forming an \u201cagreement,\u201d as discussed in new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.i, that the card may be used to access the third party's credit feature as an overdraft credit feature when all the parties understand that this type of connection is occurring. Such a result could frustrate the operation of certain consumer protections provided in the final rule. The Bureau believes that when there is a marketing agreement or arrangement between the parties as described in new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.ii.A, the parties have a sufficient connection such that the unaffiliated third party that can extend credit should understand when its credit feature is used as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account, even if there is no specific agreement between the parties to that effect under new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.i. Also, the Bureau believes that these types of links between the prepaid account issuer and the unaffiliated third party that can extend credit are likely to involve revenue sharing or payments between the two companies, and the pricing structure of the two accounts may be tied together. Thus, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to consider these entities to be business partners in this context."

Because this credit could be extended, many commenters were concerned that fees that generally applied to the prepaid account, but were not specific to the overdraft credit, could be finance charges under the proposal and thus would subject the prepaid account issuer to the credit card rules under Regulation Z. These commenters were concerned that they could not charge certain fees on the prepaid account, or would have to waive certain fees, for the prepaid card not to be a credit card under the proposal.",
                "For example, one payment network indicated that a prepaid card should not be a credit card when it accesses credit extended through a negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account if the <em data-original=\"E-03\">only</em> fees charged on the prepaid account in connection with the extension of credit are the <em data-original=\"E-03\">very same</em> fees that would apply to the same transaction on the prepaid card without an extension of credit. Similarly, two industry trade associations urged that a prepaid card should be a credit card when it accesses credit extended through a negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account only if the prepaid account issuer charges fees directly correlated with the overdraft in question. These commenters argued that a prepaid card should not be a credit card when it accesses credit extended through a negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account if the prepaid account issuer only imposes on the prepaid account fees or charges that are wholly unrelated to an overdraft, such as a fee to make a balance inquiry at an ATM. These commenters also indicated that a prepaid card should not be a credit card when the prepaid account issuer only imposes unrelated fees or charges on the prepaid account, even when these unrelated fees or charges are imposed when the prepaid account balance is negative.",
                "Another industry trade association indicated that a monthly fee to hold the prepaid account should not cause a prepaid card to be a credit card simply because the fee may be imposed when the balance on the prepaid account is negative or because negative balances can occur on the prepaid account.",

The circumstances raised by industry commenters centered on (1) force pay transactions; (2) payment cushions; and (3) transactions that take the account negative when a load of funds from an asset account is pending, as discussed in more detail below and in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a).\n          ",
                "One consumer group commenter urged the Bureau to cover all prepaid cards as credit cards when the prepaid card accesses credit, regardless of whether a finance charge, as defined in \u00a7\u20091026.4, or a fee described under \u00a7\u20091026.4(c) is imposed for the credit. This commenter recognized, however, that exceptions for force pay transactions and payment cushions may be necessary. With respect to payment cushions, this commenter supported not triggering the credit card rules where a prepaid card can only access a de minimis amount of credit, using $10 as a safe harbor, if such credit is not promoted or disclosed. With respect to force pay transactions, this commenter supported requiring a prepaid account issuer to waive the per transaction fee that is imposed on a credit transaction where credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account in order to avoid triggering the credit card rules under the proposal. Nonetheless, this commenter indicated that if the Bureau decides to make any exceptions with respect to force pay transactions, these exceptions should be limited to prepaid account issuers who do everything possible to prevent overdrafts, have overdrafts in only very rare and unpreventable situations, and do not charge penalty fees related to declined transactions, overdrafts, or negative balances.",
                "As discussed above, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) creates an exception to the general rule that credit structured as a negative balance feature on an prepaid asset account is subject to the credit card rules, in order to provide flexibility for the kinds of incidental credit that commenters raised concerns about. Specifically as described in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), an overdraft credit feature where credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account is not accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card where: (1) The prepaid card cannot access a covered separate credit feature as defined in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i); (2) with respect to the prepaid account accessible by the prepaid card, the prepaid account issuer generally has a policy and practice of declining to authorize transactions made with the card when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transactions, or the prepaid account issuer only authorizes those transactions in circumstances related to payment cushions and delayed load cushions discussed below; and (3) with respect to the prepaid account accessible by the prepaid card, the prepaid account issuer does not charge credit-related fees for any credit extended on the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law.<footnote ref=\"702\">An industry trade association and an issuing bank were concerned that all prepaid cards (and associated account numbers) could be credit cards or otherwise subject to Regulation Z solely due to the fact that the cardholder can incur an overdraft that he or she is contractually obligated to repay. These commenters asked the Bureau to clarify that \u201ccredit\u201d under Regulation Z would not include the amount of an overdraft if the consumer is not contractually obligated to reimburse the card issuer for that overdraft (&lt;em data-original=\"E-03\"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; the consumer would not be incurring debt or deferring the payment of debt) and to clarify disclosure obligations if the consumer is not contractually obligated to repay the overdraft credit. The Bureau believes that it has addressed these concerns by providing the exception in \u00a7 1026.61(a)(4) for how prepaid account issuers may provide incidental credit as a negative balance on the prepaid account without being subject to Regulation Z, even if the consumer is contractually obligated to pay these overdrafts.</footnote>\n             Each of the three prongs of the limited exception is discussed in more detail below.",
                "The Bureau believes that the exception in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) addresses many of the concerns raised by industry commenters and consumer group commenters. To address evasion risks and other concerns raised by consumer group commenters discussed above, the Bureau has carefully calibrated new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). Specifically, under the final rule, a prepaid card is not a credit card under the regulation when it accesses credit through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account only in circumstances where, with respect to a prepaid account accessible by the prepaid card: (1) The prepaid account issuer generally declines to authorize transactions on the prepaid account that will create negative balances on the asset feature of the prepaid account (or allows those authorizations in limited circumstances related to payment cushions and delayed load cushions); and (2) the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit extended on the asset feature of the prepaid account. Thus, for example, a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> a hybrid prepaid-credit card) when credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account where, with respect to the prepaid account accessible by the prepaid card: (1) The prepaid account issuer has a policy and practice of authorizing transactions (outside of the payment cushion and delayed load circumstances described above) where there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transaction at authorization; or (2) a prepaid account issuer charges credit-related fees for credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account beyond fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law.",
                "Thus, where new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) has not been satisfied, the final rule prohibits a prepaid account issuer from offering an overdraft credit feature as a negative balance to the asset feature of the prepaid account and requires the prepaid account issuer to offer the overdraft credit feature as a \u201ccovered separate credit feature\u201d under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i). Specifically, under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(3), a prepaid card that can access credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card for purposes of coverage under the credit card rules unless the card can only access credit described in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). A person offering such an overdraft credit feature is a \u201ccard issuer\u201d under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(7) and is subject to Regulation Z, including new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b). However, to facilitate transparency and compliance with Regulation Z, the Bureau is prohibiting card issuers under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b) from structuring an overdraft credit feature as a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, except as provided in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). Instead, under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b), a card issuer must structure an overdraft credit feature in connection with a prepaid account as a separate credit feature, such as a credit account or credit subaccount to the prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for overdraft credit features described in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). This separate credit feature is a \u201ccovered separate credit feature\u201d under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i).",
                "The Bureau believes that new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) will allow prepaid account issuers who do not intend to offer substantive credit programs to provide incidental credit in circumstances that will benefit consumers, without opening the door to widespread evasion of the rule. First, with respect to force pay transactions, payment cushions, and delayed load cushions, under this exception, the final rule provides that credit card rules will not be triggered so long as the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit extended and has met the other requirements. Second, the final rule provides that a prepaid account issuer is not required under this exception to waive per transaction fees imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account if the amount of the per transaction fee imposed for transactions involving credit is not higher than the amount of the fee that is imposed for transactions that only access funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account. Rather, the final rule provides that under this exception, if a fee is not a credit-related fee as enumerated in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B), the prepaid account issuer may still debit these fees or charges from the asset feature when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature to cover those fees or charges at the time they are imposed. Third, the final rule provides that under this exception, a prepaid account issuer may charge a fee to hold the prepaid account, so long as the amount of the fee or charge to hold the prepaid account imposed on the asset feature is not higher based on whether credit might be offered or has been accepted, whether or how much credit the consumer has accessed, or the amount of credit available. Fourth, the final rule provides that a prepaid account issuer may still qualify for the exception in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) even if it charges fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law, so long as the other conditions of the exception have been met.",
                "To the extent that a prepaid account issuer meets the conditions as described in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) with respect to a prepaid card, the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card and thus is not a credit card under the regulation. As discussed in more detail below, the final rule provides that in the case where a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card because the only credit it can access meets the conditions set forth in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), the prepaid account issuer is not a card issuer under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(7) with respect to the prepaid card. The prepaid account issuer also is not a creditor under final \u00a7\u20091026.17(a)(iii) or (iv) because it is not a card issuer under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(7) with respect to the prepaid card.

                "This prong is designed to limit the exception under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) to situations where the prepaid account issuer generally is not authorizing transactions that will take the asset feature of the prepaid account negative. The Bureau believes that this prong will help ensure that consumers do not develop a substantial negative balance on their prepaid asset accounts that most do not intend to use as a credit account, which could pose risks to consumers by compromising their ability to manage and control their finances. This prong is intended to address concerns raised by industry commenters that the proposed circumstances in which a prepaid card would be a credit card captured (1) \u201cforce pay\u201d transactions, (2) payment cushions; and (3) delayed load cushions, while also balancing consumer group concerns that any such limited exceptions be cabined in a way that does not undermine the broader rule. Thus, the final rule does not cover overdraft credit features under Regulation Z where these three types of credit are extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, so long as the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit.",
                "As discussed above, \u201cforce pay\u201d transactions occur where the prepaid account issuer is required by card network rules to pay a transaction even though there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the transaction at settlement. This can occur, for example, when a transaction is either not authorized in advance, or there were sufficient or available funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time the transaction is authorized, but there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature at the time the transaction is settled, and a negative balance results on the asset feature when the transaction is paid.",
                "New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(A)-1 makes clear that a prepaid account issuer is not required to receive an authorization request for each transaction to comply with this requirement. Nonetheless, the prepaid account issuer generally must establish an authorization policy as described above and have reasonable practices in place to comply with its established policy with respect to the authorization requests it receives. In that case, a prepaid account issuer is deemed to satisfy the requirement set forth in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A) even if a negative balance results on the prepaid account when a transaction is settled.",
                "New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(A)-2 also makes clear that a prepaid account issuer may still satisfy the requirements set forth in \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A) even if a negative balance results on the asset feature of the prepaid account because the prepaid account issuer debits the amount of any provisional credit that was previously granted on the prepaid account, as specified in final Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.11, so long as the prepaid account issuer otherwise complies with the conditions set forth in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). For example, under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), a prepaid account issuer may not impose a fee or charge enumerated under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) with respect to such a negative balance.",
                "This exception also allows a prepaid account issuer to adopt a payment cushion where the issuer would authorize transactions that would take the account balance negative by no more than $10 at the time the transaction is authorized. The Bureau believes that this $10 payment cushion will benefit consumers without allowing consumers to develop a substantial negative balance on their prepaid asset accounts, which could pose risks for consumers.",
                "As discussed above, one consumer group commenter suggested that prepaid account issuer should be prevented from advertising or disclosing this payment cushion in order to take advantage of any exception of this credit from coverage under Regulation Z. The final rule does not prevent a prepaid account issuer from advertising or disclosing this payment cushion to consumers in order to take advantage of the exception in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). The Bureau does not believe that it is necessary to restrict prepaid account issuers from advertising or disclosing this payment cushion to consumers, given the de minimis amount of credit ($10) that they may offer through the payment cushion. The Bureau believes that such a restriction may discourage prepaid account issuers from offering such a payment cushion, which could harm consumers.",
                "In addition, the exception allows a prepaid account issuer to adopt a delayed load cushion. Specifically, in cases where the prepaid account issuer has received an instruction or confirmation for an incoming EFT originated from a separate asset account to load funds to the prepaid account or where the prepaid account issuer has received a request from the consumer to load funds to the prepaid account from a separate asset account but in either case the funds from the separate asset account have not yet settled, a prepaid account issuer may still qualify for the exception in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) if the prepaid account authorizes transactions that take the prepaid account negative, so long as the transactions will not cause the account balance to become negative at the time of the authorization by more than the incoming or requested load amount, as applicable.",
                "The Bureau recognizes that, in some cases, a prepaid account issuer may receive instructions or confirmation with respect to incoming EFTs from a separate asset account to load funds to the prepaid account, such as in cases involving direct deposits of salaries or government benefits. In such cases, prepaid account issuers may provide access to these funds to prepaid cardholders based on the instructions or confirmations even though the prepaid account issuer's transfer of funds has not yet settled, and therefore the prepaid account issuer does not have the funds.",
                "In addition, the Bureau also recognizes that, in some cases, prepaid account issuers may receive a request from the consumer to load funds to the prepaid account from a separate asset account, including where the consumer, in the course of a transaction, requests a load from a deposit account or uses a debit card to cover the amount of the transaction. This can occur, for example, when a consumer authorizes a remittance through a mobile wallet which is linked to a checking account, the consumer requests that funds be taken from the consumer's checking account to pay for the remittance, and the remittance is sent before the incoming transfer of funds from the checking account is complete. In this case, the prepaid account issuer is extending credit through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account until the incoming transfer of funds from the checking account is complete.",
                "In these two situations, the Bureau believes that it would benefit consumers to receive access to the funds prior to settlement, so long as the consumer generally is not charged credit-related fees. The Bureau does not believe these situations raise the same concerns as overdraft credit features offered by prepaid account issuers in connection with prepaid accounts.",
                "To facilitate compliance, new comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(A)-3.i provides examples of cases where the prepaid account issuer may receive an instruction or confirmation for an incoming EFT originating from a separate asset account to load funds to the prepaid account. This comment describes that such instructions or confirmations may occur in relation to a direct deposit of salary from an employer and a direct deposit of government benefits. New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(A)-3.ii also provides an example of a case where the prepaid account issuer may receive a request from the consumer to load funds to the prepaid account from a separate asset account. This comment describes an example where the consumer, in the course of a transaction, requests a load from a deposit account or uses a debit card to cover the amount of the transaction if there are insufficient funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to pay for the transaction.",
                "New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(A)-4 also makes clear that the two circumstances described above in which a prepaid account issuer can authorize transactions that create a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, namely payment cushions and delayed load cushions, are not mutually exclusive. For example, assume a prepaid account issuer has adopted the $10 payment cushion and the delayed load cushion. Also, assume the prepaid account issuer has received an instruction or confirmation for an incoming EFT originating from a separate asset account to load funds to the prepaid account, but the prepaid account issuer has not received the funds from the separate asset account. In this case, a prepaid account issuer satisfies this requirement if the amount of a transaction at authorization will not cause the prepaid account balance to become negative at the time of the authorization by more than the requested load amount plus the $10 payment cushion.",

Specifically, the exception would only apply where the prepaid account issuer does not charge the following fees: (1) Any fees or charges for opening, issuing, or holding a negative balance on the asset feature, or for the availability of credit, whether imposed on a one-time or periodic basis. These fees do not include fees or charges to open, issue, or hold the prepaid account where the amount of the fee or charge imposed on the asset feature is not higher based on whether credit might be offered or has been accepted, whether or how much credit the consumer has accessed, or the amount of credit available; (2) any fees or charges that will be imposed only when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature, except that a prepaid account issuer may impose fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law; or (3) any fees or charges where the amount of the fee or charge is higher when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature.",
                "Thus, this prong prevents a prepaid account issuer from charging credit-related fees for the credit extended through a negative balance on the prepaid account, except for fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law. Because the credit extended through the exception in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) is intended to be limited to inadvertent or de minimis credit, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to limit the exception to instances in which the prepaid account issuer does not charge credit-related fees for the credit, except for fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law. In addition, the Bureau believes that preventing prepaid account issuers from generally charging credit-related fees to take advantage of this exception will provide greater incentive to prepaid account issuers to limit the circumstances resulting in \u201cforced pay\u201d transactions extended through this exception. For the reasons discussed in the <em data-original=\"E-03\">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to generally cover overdraft credit features offered by prepaid account issuers where, with respect to the prepaid account accessible by the prepaid card: (1) The prepaid account issuer has a policy and practice of authorizing transactions (outside of the payment cushion and delayed load circumstances described above) where there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transaction at authorization; or (2) a prepaid account issuer charges credit-related fees for credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account beyond fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law.",

For example, the terms may differ between a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is not offered in connection with any prepaid accounts within the prepaid account program and a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be offered to some consumers in connection with their prepaid accounts. The Bureau recognizes that prepaid account issuer may offer prepaid programs for different purposes and offer different services on those prepaid account programs. Those service differences may impact the pricing on the prepaid programs. The Bureau believes that requiring prepaid account issuers to charge the same fees on all of its prepaid account programs to take advantage of this exception would make the exception generally unavailable for most prepaid account issuers.",

For example, if a late fee were not included as a enumerated fee under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B), a prepaid account issuer could provide that payment of the overdraft is due immediately and charge a late fee each day that the overdraft balance remains outstanding.

The Bureau does not believe that allowing a prepaid account issuer to qualify for the exception in new \u00a7 1026.61(a)(4), even if the prepaid account issuer imposes actual collection costs to collect the credit, poses the same evasion risks discussed above in regard to late fees because these costs must be the actual costs incurred by the prepaid account issuer to collect the credit, and those fees must be otherwise permitted by law.",

A $1.50 fee is imposed each time a transaction is paid entirely from funds in the asset feature. The $15 charge is a charge where the amount of the fee or charge is higher when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature because the transaction fee is higher when the transaction accesses credit than when the transaction accesses only asset funds in the asset feature.",

For example, if a prepaid account issuer charges a higher fee for an ATM balance inquiry requested on the prepaid account if the balance inquiry is requested when there is a negative balance on the asset feature than the amount of fee imposed when there is a positive balance on the asset feature, the balance inquiry fee is a fee described in new \u00a7 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">3</em>) because the amount of the fee is higher based on whether it is imposed when there is a negative balance on the asset feature.",

For example, assume a $1.50 transaction charge is imposed on the prepaid account for each paid transaction that is made with the prepaid card, including transactions that only access asset funds, transactions that take the account balance negative, and transactions that occur when the account balance is already negative. The $1.50 transaction charge imposed on the prepaid account is not prohibited under new \u00a7 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) because the fee or charge is not higher when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature.

                        "One program manager that offers an overdraft feature in connection with some of its prepaid accounts indicated that consumers who use the overdraft feature consent to receive notifications electronically, and the program manager sends electronic messages notifying consumers when they have overdrafted. The program manager indicated that most of these consumers with the overdraft feature also choose to receive alert messages that provide balance information periodically and after every transaction. This program manager indicated that a point-of-sale opt-in may present challenges, but it may be feasible to create a program where the overdraft feature could be turned on for a time-period during which the consumer intends to use the feature.",

For the reasons discussed in the <em data-original=\"E-03\">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section, the Bureau continues to believe that it is appropriate generally to cover overdraft credit features offered by prepaid account issuers that are structured as a negative balance on the prepaid account as credit card accounts under Regulation Z, except as provided in new \u00a7 1026.61(a)(4).",
                "Accordingly, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(3)(i) provides that a prepaid card that can access credit extended through a negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card unless the card can only access incidental credit as described in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). Nonetheless, as discussed in more detail below, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(3) is intended to trigger coverage under the credit card rules with respect to such overdraft credit features. For purposes of coverage, a person offering such an overdraft credit feature is a \u201ccard issuer\u201d under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(7) that is subject to Regulation Z, including new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b). However, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(b) below, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b) prohibits card issuers from structuring an overdraft credit feature as a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, unless the program is structured to involve only incidental credit as provided in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). The Bureau believes that this rule is necessary to promote transparency and compliance with the credit card requirements. Thus, under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b), a card issuer must structure an overdraft credit feature in connection with a prepaid account as a separate credit feature, such as a credit account or credit subaccount to the prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for overdraft credit features described in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). This separate credit feature is a \u201ccovered separate credit feature\u201d under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i). Thus, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(3)(ii) provides that notwithstanding that \u00a7\u20091026.61(c)(3)(i) triggers coverage under Regulation Z, structuring a hybrid prepaid-credit card to access credit through a negative balance on the asset feature violates new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b). A prepaid account issuer can use a negative asset balance structure to extend credit on an asset feature of a prepaid account only if the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card as described in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4).",
                "In terms of providing guidance on the situations that trigger coverage under \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(3)(i), new comment 61(a)(3)(i)-1.i provides a cross-reference to new comment 2(a)(14)-3 for examples of when transactions authorized or paid on the asset feature of a prepaid account meet the definition of credit under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(14). New comment 61(a)(3)(i)-1.ii provides that except as provided in \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card would trigger coverage as a hybrid prepaid-credit card if it is a single device that can be used from time to time to access credit that can be extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account. This comment clarifies, however, that unless the only credit offered meets the requirements of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), such a product structure would violate the rules under \u00a7\u20091026.61(b).",
                "New comment 61(a)(3)(i)-1.ii also explains that a credit extension through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account can occur during the authorization phase of the transaction or in later periods up to the settlement of the transaction. New comment 61(a)(3)(i)-1.iii provides that, for example, credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account where a transaction is initiated using a prepaid card when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time the transaction is initiated, and credit is extended on the asset feature of the prepaid account when the transaction is authorized. New comment 61(a)(3)(i)-1.iv also provides, for example, that credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account where a transaction occurs when there are sufficient or available funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time of authorization to cover the amount of the transaction but where the consumer does not have sufficient or available funds in the asset feature to cover the transaction at the time of settlement. In this case, credit is extended on the asset feature at settlement to pay those transactions. Also, credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account where a transaction settles even though it was not authorized in advance, and credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature at settlement to pay that transaction.",
                "As discussed above, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(3) is intended to trigger coverage under the credit card rules with respect to such overdraft credit features. New comment 61(a)(3)(ii)-1 explains that new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(3)(i) determines whether a prepaid card triggers coverage as a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a), and thus, whether a prepaid account issuer is a card issuer under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(7) subject to this regulation, including new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b). However, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b) requires that any credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card must be structured as a separate credit feature using either a credit subaccount of the prepaid account or a separate credit account. In that case, a card issuer would violate new \u00a7\u20091026.61(b) if it structures the credit feature as a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, unless the only credit offered in connection with the prepaid account satisfies new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4). A prepaid account issuer can use a negative asset balance structure to extend credit on a prepaid account if the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card as described in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)."

New \u00a7 1026.61(b) generally requires that such credit features be structured as separate subaccounts or accounts, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with various Regulation Z requirements. New \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a \u201chybrid prepaid-credit card\u201d with respect to such a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. New \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2)(i) defines such a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as a \u201ccovered separate credit feature.\u201d The hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",
                "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61 below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii) provides that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature that does not meet both of the conditions above, for example, where the credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate or its business partner. Such credit features are defined as \u201cnon-covered separate credit features,\u201d as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) below. Second, under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61 or a credit card under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.",
                "As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is amending existing \u00a7\u20091026.4 and its commentary to (1) distinguish credit provided in connection with prepaid accounts addressed by the final rule from the overdraft services on checking accounts, which is subject to a different rulemaking process; and (2) broaden the definition of \u201cfinance charge,\u201d as applied in the prepaid context, to assure broad coverage of the credit card rules to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards and to better reflect the full cost of credit. Specifically, the final rule provides that the exclusion in existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(c)(3) for certain charges in connection with overdraft services on checking accounts does not apply to credit offered in connection with a prepaid account and that the exclusion in existing \u00a7\u20091026.4(c)(4) for participation fees does not apply to a fee to participate in a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new \u00a7\u20091026.61, regardless of whether this fee is imposed on the credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account.",
                "In addition, the Bureau is amending existing \u00a7\u20091026.4 and its commentary to provide additional clarification and guidance as to what types of fees and charges constitute \u201cfinance charges\u201d related to credit offered in connection with a prepaid account. For example, with regard to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, the Bureau has added new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11) and related commentary to address the classification of fees as finance charges depending on whether those fees are imposed on the covered separate credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account. Specifically, new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11) provides that the following fees generally are finance charges with respect to such covered separate credit features and asset features: (1) Any fee or charge, such as interest rates and service, transaction, activity, or carrying charges, imposed on the covered separate credit feature, whether it is structured as a credit subaccount of the prepaid account or a separate credit account; and (2) any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.",
                "The commentary to new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11) also provides guidance with regard to the treatment of fees imposed on the prepaid account in relation to credit features accessible by prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards. For example, with regard to non-covered separate credit features, the final rule provides that new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11) and related commentary do not apply to fees or charges imposed on the non-covered separate credit feature; instead, the non-covered credit feature is evaluated in its own right under the general rules set forth in existing \u00a7\u20091026.4 to determine whether these fees or charges are finance charges. In addition, with respect to these non-covered separate credit features, fees or charges on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges under existing \u00a7\u20091026.4 with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. The commentary also provides that with respect to incidental credit that is provided via a negative balance on the prepaid account under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), fees that can be imposed on the prepaid account under \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) are not finance charges under final \u00a7\u20091026.4."

Thus, such a declined transaction fee is prohibited by final \u00a7 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>), regardless of whether the fee is imposed on the credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account.",

One of these consumer group commenters indicated that it could be confusing to determine whether a declined transaction would have accessed the prepaid account or a credit feature. This commenter believed that these fees are unfair penalty fees, especially if they exceed the cost (if any) to the prepaid account issuer of the declined transaction. Consistent with the proposal, new comment 52(b)(2)(i)-7 makes clear that fees imposed for declining a transaction that would have only accessed the asset feature of the prepaid account and would not have accessed the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card are not covered by final \u00a7\u20091026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>).

The Bureau further notes, however, that although the Board did not address declined transaction fees in its 2009 rulemaking addressing overdraft services, the Board noted in response to comments received that such fees could raise significant fairness issues under the FTC Act, because the institution bears little, if any, risk or cost to decline authorization of an ATM or one-time debit card transaction. &lt;em data-original=\"E-03\"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 74 FR 59033, 59041 (Nov. 17, 2009).</footnote>\n          ",

First, the existing text of the comment would have been placed in proposed comment 2(a)(15)-3.i and a new comment 2(a)(15)-3.ii would have been added. Specifically, proposed comment 2(a)(15)-3.ii would have explained that a prepaid card is a charge card if it also is a credit card where no periodic rate is used to compute the finance charge. This proposed comment also would have explained that, unlike other charge cards, a prepaid card that is a charge card that accesses a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan would be subject to the requirements in proposed \u00a7\u20091026.7(b)(11)(i)(A), which would have required payment due dates to be disclosed on periodic statements for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan.

These credit features will always be associated with this linked asset account, and the Bureau believes that prepaid card users who use the cards to obtain consumer credit from a covered separate credit feature are likely to have lower credit scores than credit card users overall. Unlike traditional secured credit cards, these prepaid cards likely would not be marketed as secured credit cards and would not require consumers to establish a new separate account or to set aside specific funds. As a result, prepaid consumers are less likely than secured credit card users to understand that they are required to provide a security interest in the prepaid account in order to receive the covered separate credit feature. In addition, these prepaid consumers may have a need to be able to manage their prepaid accounts very carefully to cover both daily expenses and any credit repayments.",
                        "With regard to security interests in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, the Bureau believes that all of the indicia in new comment 12(d)(2)-2.iii, including delineating a specific dollar amount as being subject to the security interest, will help to ensure that such security interest arrangements do not circumvent the offset provision in TILA section 169 by ensuring that consumers focus careful attention on the consequences of granting security interests so that consumers are better prepared to manage their accounts to both cover daily expenses and repay any credit extensions.",
                        "At this time, the Bureau does not believe that it is necessary to ban security interests in prepaid accounts or to provide that a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card only can be secured by a separate asset account that is not the prepaid account. The Bureau believes that the protections adopted in the final rule are sufficient to protect consumers from security interests taken in prepaid account with respect to a covered separate credit feature from becoming functional equivalents of offsets, but the Bureau will continue to monitor how providers in the prepaid market use consensual security interests."

Thus, under proposed \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(3), with respect to such credit plans accessed by prepaid card that is a credit card, a card issuer would have been permitted to deduct all or a part of the cardholder's credit card debt automatically from the prepaid account or other deposit account held by the card issuer no more frequently than once per month, pursuant to a signed, written authorization by the cardholder to do so. Proposed comment 12(d)(3)-3 would have provided an example to illustrate when card issuers could deduct automatically all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer under proposed \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(3) with respect to credit cards that are also prepaid cards.

In this case, the card issuer would not have been prohibited under proposed \u00a7\u20091026.12(d) from automatically deducting the amount due on the periodic statement on the 25th of each month, or on an earlier date in each calendar month, from a deposit account held by the card issuer if the deductions were pursuant to a plan that was authorized in writing by the cardholder (as discussed in existing comment 12(d)(3)-1) and complied with the limitations in existing \u00a7\u20091026.13(d)(1).

The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61 and a credit card under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",

As discussed in the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.5(b)(2)(ii) and 1026.7(b)(11) above, for covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, the card issuer must adopt reasonable procedures to ensure that periodic statements are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the periodic statement, and the due date must be the same day of the month for each billing cycle.",
                        "The Bureau is concerned that, with respect to covered separate credit features that are accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, some card issuers may attempt to circumvent the prohibition on offsets by obtaining a consumer's written authorization to deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt on the covered separate credit feature on a daily or weekly basis from the prepaid account to help ensure that the debt is repaid. If \u201cperiodically\u201d is not defined for purposes of final \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(3), the Bureau believes that card issuers that offer covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may obtain a consumer's written authorization to daily or weekly debits to the prepaid account to repay the credit card debt on the covered separate credit feature given the overall creditworthiness of prepaid accountholders who rely on covered separate credit features. In addition, the Bureau believes prepaid consumers may grant the authorization more readily than other credit cardholders because these consumers may believe that providing such authorization is required.",
                        "An appropriate interval for \u201cperiodic[]\u201d deduction plans may depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular credit feature, but because of the above reasons, the Bureau believes that an appropriate interval for covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards is no more frequently than once per calendar month.",
                        "The Bureau believes that the requirement in final \u00a7\u20091026.12(d)(3), along with changes to the timing requirement for a periodic statement in final \u00a7\u20091026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) and the compulsory use provision in Regulation E (final \u00a7\u20091005.10(e)(1)), are necessary to fully effectuate the intent of the provisions and would allow consumers to retain control over the funds in their prepaid accounts even when a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card becomes associated with that account, which is consistent with the prohibition on offsets. In particular, with these changes, such card issuers (1) are required to adopt reasonable procedures designed to ensure that periodic statements for covered separate credit features are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the periodic statement, and the due date disclosed must be the same day of the month for each billing cycle; (2) can move funds automatically from the asset account held by the card issuer to the credit card account held by the card issuer to pay some or all of the credit card debt on covered separate credit features no more frequently than once per month, such as on the payment due date (pursuant to the consumer's signed, written agreement that the issuer may do so); and (3) are required to offer consumers a means to repay their outstanding credit balances on covered separate credit features other than automatic repayment (such as by means of a transfer of funds from the asset account to the credit account that the consumer initiates on the prepaid account's online banking Web site).",

Thus, under the final rule, a consumer may still provide specific requests for payment more frequently than once per month as described in existing comment 12(d)(3)-2.ii (for example, a cardholder might check a box on the credit card bill stub, requesting the issuer to debit the cardholder's account to pay that bill), so long as those payments are not on an automatic periodic basis more frequently than once per month.",

This clarification applies to both covered separate credit features accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card and non-covered separate credit features that are subject to final \u00a7\u20091026.12(d).<footnote ref=\"656\">With respect to incidental credit that meets the conditions set forth in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)(ii)(C) makes clear that a prepaid account issuer may still satisfy the exception in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4) even if it debits fees or charges from the asset feature when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature to cover those fees or charges at the time they are imposed, so long as those fees or charges are not credit-related fees enumerated in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B). New comment 61(a)(4)-1.iv.A states that for this type of credit, the prepaid account issuer is not a card issuer under \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(7) with respect to the prepaid card.</footnote>\n          ",

New \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(i) defines such a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as a \u201ccovered separate credit feature.\u201d Thus, the hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",

As described in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2)(ii), a non-covered separate credit feature is not subject to the rules applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards; however, it typically will be subject to Regulation Z depending on its own terms and conditions, independent of the connection to the prepaid account. Thus, a non-covered separate credit feature may be subject to the provisions in \u00a7\u20091026.12(d) in its own right based on the terms and conditions of the non-covered separate credit feature, independent of the connection to the prepaid account.",
                        "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3) above, the Bureau is adding new \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1 which provide that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new \u00a7\u20091026.61, the term \u201ccharges imposed as part of the plan\u201d does not include any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge does not exceed comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. As described in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11) above, these fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges under new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii). With respect to a covered separate credit feature, new comment 12(d)(3)-2.iii makes clear that final \u00a7\u20091026.12(d) does not prevent a card issuer from automatically deducting from a consumer's deposit account, such as a prepaid account, held with the card issuer any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under new \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) with respect to the covered separate credit feature. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of \u00a7\u00a7\u20091026.4 and 1026.6, the Bureau believes that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account that are not finance charges, and thus are not charges imposed as part of the plan under new \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D), are more appropriately regulated under Regulation E than under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",

Because none of the fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are charges imposed as part of the plan with respect to a non-covered separate credit feature under new \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E), final \u00a7\u20091026.12(d) does not prevent a card issuer from automatically deducting any of these fees or charges from a consumer's deposit account, such as a prepaid account, held with the card issuer.

The Bureau also believes that additional protections with respect to the offset provision in final \u00a7 1026.12(d) are needed with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, as discussed in the section-by-section discussion of \u00a7 1026.12(d)(2) and (3). The Bureau believes that the requirements in final \u00a7 1026.12(d), along with changes to the timing requirement for a periodic statement in final \u00a7 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) and the compulsory use provision in Regulation E (final \u00a7 1005.10(e)(1)), are important protections that will allow consumers to retain control over the funds in their prepaid accounts if a covered separate credit feature becomes associated with those accounts because they will be able to control when and how debts are repaid.",

The Bureau does not believe that special guidance related to payroll deduction plans is necessary. The Bureau believes that under the current offset provision (and the final rule), the offset provision would apply to payroll deductions that are deposited into a consumer's asset account that is held by the credit card issuer. Nonetheless, the offset provision does not apply if the payroll deductions are deposited into a consumer's asset account that is held with the employer or with a person other than the credit card issuer. The offset provision also would not apply to payroll deductions that are used directly to pay a covered separate credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card where payroll deduction funds are never deposited into a consumer's asset account with the credit card issuer."

In a payroll deduction plan in which funds are deposited to a prepaid account held by the card issuer, and from which payments are made on a monthly basis to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card that is held by the card issuer, payment is received on the date when it is debited to the prepaid account (rather than on the date of the deposit), provided the payroll deduction method is voluntary and the consumer retains use of the funds until the contractual payment date. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new \u00a7\u20091026.61 and a credit card under final \u00a7\u20091026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature."

For example, assume a prepaid account issuer charges a $0.50 per transaction fee on an asset feature of the prepaid account for purchases when a hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing purchase transactions conducted with the card and a $0.50 transaction fee for purchases that access funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account in the same program without such a credit feature. In this case, the $0.50 fees are comparable. Thus, the $0.50 fee for purchases when a hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction conducted with the card is not a charge imposed as part of the plan. However, in this example, if the prepaid account issuer imposes a $1.25 per transaction fee on an asset feature of the prepaid account for purchases when a hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing purchase transactions conducted with the card, the $0.75 excess is a charge imposed as part of the plan with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",

As a result, any per transaction fees for those transactions would be disclosed under both Regulations Z and E, even if the fee is not a finance charge under new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii). For example, assume a prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset balance of the prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. Also, assume that the prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 per transaction on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction.

Pursuant to final Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4) and (f)(1), these per transaction fees must be disclosed in the long form pre-acquisition disclosure and in the initial disclosures for the prepaid account, respectively, because they are imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account. In addition, under existing Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.9(b), these per transaction fees must also be disclosed on the Regulation E periodic statement or on the written and electronic transaction histories pursuant to the periodic statement alternative under final Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.18(c)(1) because these fees are imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See also</em> final Regulation E \u00a7 1005.18(c)(4).",

As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii), the Bureau believes that to the extent that a prepaid account issuer is charging the same comparable fee on the asset balance of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature as the fee that it charges on a prepaid account in the same prepaid account program without such a credit feature, the fee is not being charged for credit and thus, is not a finance charge. As such, the Bureau believes that these fees are more appropriately disclosed on the Regulation E disclosures for the asset feature of the prepaid account and should not be disclosed as well on the Regulation Z disclosures with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",

For example, assume a creditor imposes a $1.25 per transaction fee on an asset feature of the prepaid account for purchases when a hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing purchase transactions conducted with the card and a $0.50 transaction fee for purchases that access funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account in the same program without such a credit feature. In this case, the $0.75 excess is a \u201ccharge imposed as part of the plan\u201d under \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3) and must be disclosed as a transaction fee for purchases under \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(2)(iv) in the account-opening table. New comment 6(b)(2)-2 clarifies that a creditor is not required to disclose in the account-opening table under final \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(2) any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under final \u00a7\u20091026.6(b)(3).",
                        "To ease compliance risk and burden and for other reasons, with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, the Bureau expects that prepaid account issuers will choose not to impose finance charges on the asset feature of the prepaid account. Instead, the Bureau expects that prepaid account issuers will choose to charge comparable fees on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a linked covered separate credit feature as those charged on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that are not linked to a covered separate credit feature. The Bureau expects that prepaid account issuers will choose to impose finance charges on the credit feature itself, and not on the asset feature of the prepaid account.",
                        "As noted above, if a prepaid account issuer does impose finance charges on the asset feature of the prepaid account, as described in new \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii), these finance charges must be disclosed under both Regulations Z and E as applicable. In that case, the prepaid account issuer must coordinate the disclosures under Regulations Z and E and must provide these disclosures in a way that ensures that consumers understand the fees that could be imposed. Nonetheless, as discussed above, the Bureau believes that most prepaid account issuers will choose to avoid imposing finance charges on the asset feature of the prepaid account in order to avoid compliance issues and risks related to providing disclosures with respect to these fees under both Regulations E and Z."

In those cases, existing \u00a7 1026.13(i) applies when a transaction is partially funded through an EFT from an asset account and partially funded through an overdraft credit line. Such transactions will be subject to both Regulation Z and E.

The provisions of existing \u00a7 1026.13(d) and (g) would still apply to the credit portion of these transactions. Currently under Regulation Z, with respect to an asset account with a linked overdraft line of credit: (1) if a transaction only accesses the overdraft line of credit and does not access funds in the asset account, the error resolution provisions in Regulation Z apply, and the error resolution provisions in Regulation E do not apply; and (2) if a transaction only accesses the funds in the asset account and does not access the overdraft line of credit, the error resolution provisions in Regulation E apply, and the error resolution provisions in Regulation Z do not apply. In addition, current Regulation Z does not apply to overdraft credit where there is not an agreement to extend credit. As discussed in existing comment 13(i)-2, overdraft transactions made under those overdraft credit programs are governed solely by the error resolution provisions in Regulation E. Existing comment 13(i)-3 provides an example of the application of existing \u00a7 1026.13(i) to transactions where a consumer withdraws money at an ATM machine and activates an overdraft line of credit on the checking account.",

Although billing errors under existing \u00a7\u20091026.13(a) include a broader category than only unauthorized use, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its adjustment and exception authority under TILA section 105(a) to apply Regulation E's error resolution provisions and limited Regulation Z error resolution provisions to these transactions, to facilitate compliance with EFTA section 908 and TILA section 161 on error resolution. The Bureau is concerned that conflicting provisions could apply to transactions that debit a prepaid account but also draw on a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card if Regulation E's provisions applied to limits on liability for unauthorized use, and Regulation Z's provisions generally apply to investigation of billing errors, including transactions involving unauthorized use. To avoid these potential conflicts and to facilitate compliance, new \u00a7\u20091026.13(i)(2) requires a creditor to comply with the requirements of final Regulation E \u00a7\u00a7\u20091005.11 and 1005.18(e) governing error resolution, rather than those of \u00a7\u20091026.13(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), and (h), if the transaction debits a prepaid account but also draws on a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.

New Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(C) provides that with respect to transactions that involve credit extended through a negative balance to the asset feature of a prepaid account that meets the conditions set forth in \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), these transactions are governed solely by error resolution procedures in Regulation E, and Regulation Z does not apply. New Regulation E \u00a7\u20091005.12(a)(1)(iv)(D) and (2)(iii), taken together, provide that with respect to transactions involving a prepaid account and a non-covered separate credit feature as defined in \u00a7\u20091026.61, a financial institution must comply with Regulation E's error resolution procedures with respect to transactions that access the prepaid account as applicable, and the creditor must comply with Regulation Z's error resolution procedures with respect to transactions that access the non-covered separate credit feature, as applicable.",

Instead, the prepaid account issuer must comply with Regulation E with respect to the transactions on the prepaid account, and the creditor must comply with Regulation Z with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. The Bureau believes that it is appropriate that a non-related third-party creditor must comply only with Regulation Z error resolution procedures with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature even if the credit feature functions as an overdraft credit feature because this creditor may not know that its credit feature is being used as an overdraft credit feature in relation to the prepaid account."

As discussed in the <em data-original=\"E-03\">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section above and in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.61 below, the Bureau generally intends to cover under Regulation Z overdraft credit features in connection with prepaid accounts where the credit features are offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or its business partners. New \u00a7 1026.61(b) generally requires that such credit features be structured as separate subaccounts or accounts, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with various Regulation Z requirements. New \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a \u201chybrid prepaid-credit card\u201d with respect to a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. New \u00a7 1026.61(a)(2)(i) defines such a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as a \u201ccovered separate credit feature.\u201d Thus, the hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.",

Second, under new \u00a7\u20091026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit.

The Bureau was authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act to define the term \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d and has done so in its 2013 ATR Final Rule. However, the 2013 ATR Final Rule does not define the types of reverse mortgage loans that should be considered \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d because, by statute, TILA's ability-to-repay rules do not apply to reverse mortgages. See TILA section 129C(a)(8), 15 U.S.C. 1639c(a)(8). Thus the Agencies are not able to implement the precise statutory exemption for \u201creverse mortgage loans that are qualified mortgages.\u201d Instead, the exemption for reverse mortgages is based on the Agencies' express authority to exempt from TILA's \u201chigher-risk mortgage\u201d appraisal rules \u201ca class of loans,\u201d if the exemption \u201cis in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors.\u201d TILA section 129H(b)(4)(B), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(4)(B).",

As noted, high-cost mortgages will be subject to these restrictions in addition to the requirements imposed in this final rule. With respect to prepayment penalty revisions, the Dodd-Frank Act deleted the statutory restrictions applicable to high-cost mortgages.

Thus, any loan that triggers the high-cost mortgage provisions through the points and fees criteria could not satisfy the qualified mortgage definition. Likewise, \u00a7 1026.43(g) of this final rule provides that, where qualified mortgages are permitted to have prepayment penalties, such penalties may not be imposed more than three years after consummation or in an amount that exceeds 2 percent of the amount prepaid.
