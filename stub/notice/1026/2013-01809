Section 1110 of FIRREA directs each Federal financial institutions regulatory agency\n      to prescribe \u201cappropriate standards for the performance of real estate appraisals in connection with federally related transactions under the jurisdiction of each such agency or instrumentality.\u201d 12 U.S.C. 3339. These rules must require, at a minimum\u2014(1) that real estate appraisals be performed in accordance with generally accepted appraisal standards as evidenced by the appraisal standards promulgated by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation; and (2) that such appraisals shall be written appraisals. 12 U.S.C. 3339(1) and (2).",

FIRREA section 1110(3), 12 U.S.C. 3339(3). FIRREA section 1110 also provides that each Federal banking agency may require compliance with additional standards if the agency determines in writing that additional standards are required to properly carry out its statutory responsibilities. 12 U.S.C. 3339. Accordingly, the Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies have prescribed appraisal regulations implementing FIRREA title XI that set forth, among other requirements, minimum standards for the performance of real estate appraisals in connection with \u201cfederally related transactions,\u201d which are defined as real estate-related financial transactions that a Federal banking agency engages in, contracts for, or regulates, and that require the services of an appraiser.\n      12 U.S.C. 3339, 3350(4).",

While the Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies' requirements in FIRREA also apply to an institution's ordering and review of an appraisal, the Agencies proposed that the definition of \u201ccertified or licensed appraiser\u201d incorporate only FIRREA title XI's minimum standards related to the appraiser's performance of the appraisal. Accordingly, a proposed comment clarified that the relevant standards \u201capplicable to appraisers\u201d are found in regulations prescribed under FIRREA section 1110 (12 U.S.C. 3339) \u201cthat relate to an appraiser's development and reporting of the appraisal,\u201d and that paragraph (3) of FIRREA, which relates to the review of appraisals, is not relevant.

The Agencies also believe that, by placing this rule in TILA, Congress did not intend to limit its application to loans over $250,000. The Agencies adopt this broader interpretation in the final rule.",

The appraiser trade associations and the housing advocate commenters believed that all higher-risk mortgages must be included in the rule to ensure that consumers receive the protections offered by appraisals. The housing advocate commenter also believed that including all higher-risk mortgages would reduce risk to all parties involved in the financing and servicing of mortgages and would ensure equal access to credit. This commenter specifically requested that the Agencies at least require an interior appraisal by licensed appraisers for all residential mortgages above $50,000, regardless of whether they are originated or insured by the private sector, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).",

The banking trade association commenter believed the Agencies should not require the rule to apply to loans held in portfolio or loans with a value of $250,000 or less, because a bank holding a loan in portfolio has strong incentive to ensure that the property sale is legitimate and the property is properly valued. The commenter also believed the statute intended to apply the rules only to the subset of higher-risk mortgages with a value of over $250,000, as is provided in the Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies' regulations implementing FIRREA. The banking trade association and a bank commenter noted that many community banks, particularly in rural areas, limit costs to consumers by not requiring appraisals on mortgages held in portfolio of $250,000 or less as permitted under FIRREA title XI or by performing cheaper, in-house evaluations of property.",

TILA section 129H(b)(3), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(3). The Agencies also did not propose to interpret \u201ccertified or licensed appraiser\u201d to include requirements related to appraisal review under FIRREA section 1110(3) because these requirements relate to an institution's responsibilities after receiving the appraisal, rather than to how the certified or licensed appraiser performs the appraisal. Comment 35(c)(1)(i)-3 is consistent with the proposal in this regard. Accordingly, as proposed, the final rule includes a comment clarifying that the requirements of FIRREA section 1110(3) that relate to the \u201cappropriate review\u201d of appraisals are not relevant for purposes of whether an appraiser is a certified or licensed appraiser under the proposal. See comment 35(c)(1)(i)-3.",
                        "At the same time and in light of public comments, the Agencies reviewed the relevant statutory provisions and confirmed their conclusion that applying the FIRREA requirements related to an appraiser's performance of an appraisal broadly\u2014to transactions originated by creditors and transaction types not necessarily subject to FIRREA (such as loans of $250,000 or less)\u2014is wholly consistent with the consumer protection purpose of title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as specific language of the appraisal provisions. For example, the Agencies believe that if Congress intended to limit application of the FIRREA requirements to mortgage loans covered by FIRREA, such as loans of over $250,000 made by Federally-regulated depositories, Congress would have expressly done so. Instead, Congress placed the appraisal requirements, including the definition of \u201ccertified and licensed appraiser\u201d referencing FIRREA, in TILA, which applies to loans made by all types of creditors. Moreover, limiting coverage of the Dodd-Frank Act higher-risk mortgage appraisal rules to loans of over $250,000 would eliminate protections for most higher-risk mortgage consumers.\n        From a practical standpoint, the Agencies believe that the most reasonable interpretation of the statute is that all mortgage loans meeting the definition of \u201chigher-risk mortgage\u201d are subject to a uniform set of rules, regardless of the type of creditor. This creates a level playing field and ensures the same protections for all consumers of \u201chigher-risk mortgages.\u201d For these reasons, consistent with the proposal, the final rule applies the FIRREA requirements to appraisals for all HPMLs that are not exempt from the regulation.

The commenters supported exempting loans secured solely by manufactured homes. Banking trade association commenters believed that the statute was intended to apply only to loans secured at least in part by real property. A manufactured housing industry consultant, a manufactured housing lender, and manufactured housing trade association commenters concurred that traditional appraisals were not appropriate for these transactions for a variety of reasons, including: (1) A lack of qualified and trained appraisers to appraise such transactions, especially in rural areas; (2) a lack of comparable sales and limited sales volume; (3) the high expense of appraisals relative to the cost of the transaction; and (4) inaccurate valuations resulting from traditional appraisals. The manufactured housing industry consultant suggested that an exemption was necessary in part because these loans were unlikely to qualify for the qualified mortgage exemption due to their small size, which would in turn increase the likelihood that they would exceed the points and fees thresholds defining qualified mortgages.

Manufactured housing trade association commenters argued that traditional appraisals are not appropriate for these transactions for many of the same reasons cited for excluding loans secured solely by a residential structure. One of these manufactured housing trade associations also expressed the view that appraisals are not appropriate because the cost of the home itself is readily known to consumers through other means. In addition, the commenter stated that in rural areas, the cost of the land is small compared to the overall value of the transaction.\n        This commenter recommended that if the Agencies did not exclude all land home transactions, the Agencies in the alternative should at least exclude those land home transactions that are under $125,000 or that are in a rural area.",

Moreover, the commenter stated that manufactured homes are typically not available for an interior visit until after closing, regardless of whether the transaction is secured solely by the home itself or by land and home together. As an alternative, the commenter suggested different regulatory language for the exclusion, which would expand the exemption to land home transactions and would incorporate an existing definition of \u201cmanufactured home\u201d to clearly eliminate site-built manufactured homes from the exemption."

Exempting new manufactured homes from the rule is, therefore, in the public interest.

                        "The financial holding company, mortgage company, banking association, and loan origination software company commenters supported an exemption for new construction loans because they are temporary. One of these commenters noted that most mortgage-related regulations, such as those in Regulation X and Z, make accommodations for temporary loans. Others noted that the property securing the new construction loan ultimately will be subject to an appraisal under TILA's \u201chigher-risk mortgage\u201d appraisal rules if the permanent financing replacing the new construction loan is a \u201chigher-risk mortgage.\u201d",
                        "Several commenters supporting an exemption cited concerns about the feasibility and utility of performing interior inspection appraisals during the construction phase. A bank commenter stated that an exemption was needed because a home under construction is not available for a physical inspection. Similarly, credit union association and banking association commenters stated that an interior visit would not be feasible during the construction phase. Moreover, the commenter believed an appraisal was unlikely to yield sufficient information about the condition of the property to justify the expense to the consumer. A banking association commenter further asserted that the usual value of a new construction loan is the value \u201cat completion,\u201d so an appraisal performed during construction would not assess the value of a completed home.",
                        "A State banking association commenter asserted that failing to exempt new construction loans from the final rule would result in operational difficulties and that an interior inspection appraisal would be of little value to consumers in these circumstances. A bank commenter requested guidance on how to comply with the rules for these loans, if the Agencies did not exempt them from the rule."

This is because the Agencies recognize that new construction might take longer than twelve months and that therefore new construction loans might be for terms of longer than twelve months. This aspect of the exemption adopted in the final rule also reflects the existing exemption for new construction loans from the current HPML rules. See \u00a7 1026.35(a)(3).",
                        "The Agencies' decision to exempt these types of transactions is consistent with wide support for this exemption received from commenters, which largely confirmed the Agencies' concerns about the drawbacks of subjecting these transactions to the new HPML appraisal requirements, particularly the requirement for an interior inspection, USPAP-compliant appraisal. The Agencies also believe that this exemption is important to ensure consistency across mortgage rules, and thus to facilitate compliance. In addition to noting the existing exemption for new construction loans from the current HPML requirements, the Agencies also note the exemption for these loans from the new Dodd-Frank Act ability-to-repay and \u201chigh-cost\u201d mortgage rules issued by the Bureau. See 2013 ATR Final Rule, \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(ii), and 2013 HOEPA Final Rule, \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(ii).",
                        "Due to their temporary nature and for other reasons, these loans tend to have higher rates and thus more of them would be subject to the HPML appraisal rules without an exemption. Applying the HPML appraisal rules to these products might subject them to rules with which creditors might not in fact be able to comply. The Agencies therefore believe that this exemption will help ensure that a useful credit vehicle for consumers remains available to build and revitalize communities. The Agencies also recognize that new construction loans can be an important product for many creditors, enabling them to strengthen and diversify their lending portfolios. The Agencies are also not aware of, and commenters did not offer, evidence of widespread valuation abuses in loans to finance new construction. Thus, the Agencies find that the exemption is both in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors. See TILA section 129H(b)(4)(B), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(4)(B).",
                        "The Agencies also wished to clarify in the final rule the treatment of \u201cconstruction to permanent\u201d loans, consisting of a single loan that transforms into permanent financing at the end of the construction phase. For this reason, the commentary of the final rule includes guidance on the application of various rules in Regulation Z to these loans that parallels guidance provided in commentary for the new \u201chigh-cost\u201d mortgage rules. See 2013 HOEPA Final Rule, comment 32(a)(2)(ii)-1. Specifically, comment 35(c)(2)(iv)-1 clarifies that the exclusion for loans to finance the initial construction of a dwelling applies to a construction-only loan as well as to the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan. The comment further clarifies that the HPML appraisal rules in \u00a7 1026.35(c) do apply if the permanent financing qualifies as an HPML under \u00a7 1026.35(a)(1) and is not otherwise exempt from the rules under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2).",
                        "The comment also provides guidance on the application of Regulation Z's general closed-end mortgage loan disclosure requirements to construction-to-permanent loans. To this end, the comment states that, when a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the general disclosure requirements for closed-end credit (\u00a7 1026.17) provide that the creditor may give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See \u00a7 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) and comment 17(c)(6)-2. The comment explains that \u00a7 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) addresses only how a creditor may elect to disclose a construction-to-permanent transaction, and that which disclosure option a creditor elects under \u00a7 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) does not affect whether the permanent phase of the transaction is subject to \u00a7 1026.35(c). The comment further explains that, when the creditor discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under \u00a7 1026.35(c). The comment also explains that, when the creditor discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with \u00a7 1026.35 and appendix D to part 1026. The comment also clarifies that the APR must be compared to the APOR for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under \u00a7 1026.35(c). If the transaction is determined to be an HPML that is not otherwise exempt under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2), only the permanent phase is subject to the HPML appraisal requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(c)."

Several commenters emphasized that these loans are temporary, and some further pointed out that imposing appraisal requirements was unnecessary because bridge loans are ultimately converted to permanent financing that will be subject to the appraisal rules. Other commenters argued that the protections of the appraisal rules were not needed because bridge loans' higher rates are generally unrelated to a consumer's creditworthiness; they argued that TILA's new \u201chigher-risk mortgage\u201d appraisal rules were intended for loans made to more vulnerable, less creditworthy consumers without other credit options.",

First, the Agencies believe that with this exemption, the consumer would still be afforded the protection of the appraisal rules. This is because bridge loans used in connection with the acquisition of a new home are typically secured by the consumer's existing home to facilitate the purchase of a new home. Thus, the consumer would be afforded the protections of the appraisal rules on the permanent financing secured by the new home. This would include the protections of \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(i) regarding properties that are potentially fraudulent flips.",
                        "Second, commenters generally confirmed the Agencies' concerns expressed in the proposal about the burden to both creditors and consumers of imposing TILA section 129H's heightened appraisal requirements on short-term financing of this nature. As noted in the proposal, the Agencies recognize that rates on short-term bridge loans are often higher than on long-term home mortgages, so these loans may be more likely to meet the \u201chigher-risk mortgage loan\u201d triggers. As also noted in the proposal and echoed by commenters, \u201chigher-risk mortgages\u201d under TILA section 129H would generally be a credit option for less creditworthy consumers, who may be more vulnerable than others and in need of enhanced consumer protections, such as TILA section 129H's special appraisal requirements. However, a bridge loan consumer could be subject to rates that would exceed the higher-risk mortgage loan thresholds even if the consumer would qualify for a non-higher-risk mortgage loan when seeking permanent financing. The Agencies do not believe that Congress intended TILA section 129H to apply to loans simply because they have higher rates, regardless of the consumer's creditworthiness or the purpose of the loan.",
                        "Further, the Agencies recognize that the exemption can help facilitate compliance by generally ensuring consistency across residential mortgage rules. Such consistency can reduce compliance-related burdens and risks, thereby promoting the safety and soundness of creditors. The Agencies also believe that consistency across the rules can reduce operational risk and support a creditor's ability to offer these loans, which can enable creditors to strengthen and diversify their lending portfolios.",
                        "In particular, the Agencies note the current exemption for \u201ctemporary or `bridge' loans of twelve months or less from the existing HPML rules (retained in the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(i)(C)), but also a similar exemption from TILA's new ability-to-repay requirements. See existing \u00a7 1026.35(a)(3). See TILA section 129C(a)(8), 15 U.S.C. 1639c(a)(8); 2013 ATR Final Rule, \u00a7 1026.43(a)(3)(ii).\n        In addition, longstanding HOEPA rules have included an exception from the balloon payment prohibition for \u201cloans with maturities of less than one year, if the purpose of the loan is a `bridge' loan connected with the acquisition or construction of a dwelling intended to become the consumer's principal dwelling.\u201d \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii). The final HOEPA rules adopted by the Bureau contain the same exception with minor changes for conformity across mortgage rules. See 2013 HOEPA Final Rule, \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(B) (revising the exception to cover bridge loans of 12 months or less, rather than less than one year).",
                        "Like the HOEPA exception from the balloon payment prohibition, the final HPML appraisal rule does not exempt all loans with terms of 12 months or less. Only bridge loans of 12 months or less that are made in connection with the acquisition of a consumer's principal dwelling are exempted. (Construction loans are separately exempted under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2)(iv), discussed in the corresponding section-by-section analysis above.) The Agencies believe that the HPML appraisal rule might be appropriately applied to other types of temporary financing, particularly temporary financing that does not result in the consumer ultimately obtaining permanent financing covered by the appraisal rule.",

Proprietary reverse mortgage loans are not insured by FHA or any other government entity, so payments are not guaranteed by the U.S. government to either consumers or creditors. By contrast, HECMs are insured by FHA and subject to a number of rules and restrictions designed to reduce risk to both consumers and creditors, including appraisal rules.

Many (and historically most) reverse mortgages are open-end products. The Agencies are concerned about creating anomalies in the market and compliance confusion among creditors by applying one set of rules to closed-end reverse mortgages and another to open-end reverse mortgages. The Agencies note that compliance confusion among creditors can create burden and operational risk that can have a negative impact on the safety and soundness of the creditors. The Agencies are concerned that this bifurcation of the rule's application could also hinder creditors from offering a range of reverse mortgage product choices that support the creditors' loan portfolios while also benefitting consumers.

A GSE suggested that the Agencies exempt from the second appraisal requirement sales that are subject to an \u201canti-flipping\u201d clause.

                        "As noted, the Agencies are adopting a tiered approach to the proposed exemption from the additional appraisal requirement of TILA section \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(i) for HPMLs that finance the resale of properties that do not exceed certain price increases from the prior sale. Specifically, \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) exempts from the additional appraisal requirement HPMLs that finance the consumer's purchase of a property within 90 days of the seller's acquisition of the property where the resale price does not exceed 10 percent of the seller's acquisition price. Section 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(B), exempts from the additional appraisal requirement HPMLs that finance the consumer's purchase of a property within 91 to 180 days of the seller's acquisition of the property where the resale price does not exceed 20 percent of the seller's acquisition price. In developing this approach, the Agencies reviewed public comments as well as other government standards and rules designed to curb harmful flipping in residential mortgage transactions. These included short sale reselling restrictions imposed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Treasury Department,\n        as well as HUD's Anti-Flipping Rules\u2014both HUD's existing regulations (24 CFR 203.37a(b)) and HUD rules currently in effect that temporarily \u201cwaive\u201d existing regulations and replace them with other standards.\n      ",
                        "The Agencies believe that short sale reselling restrictions of the GSEs and Treasury are instructive. Like these rules, the final rule incorporates a bifurcated approach to addressing fraudulent flipping, based on the number of days between the seller's purchase and the consumer's purchase.\n        The Agencies are not adopting an exemption for HPMLs financing sales subject to an anti-flipping clause, however. The Agencies are concerned that such an exemption would not be sufficiently protective of the HPML consumers the statute was intended to protect. If such an exemption covered only loans subject to GSE and Treasury anti-flipping clauses, HPML consumers purchasing homes from investors who acquired them from GSEs or Treasury would not receive the protection of the additional appraisal requirement. Meanwhile, HPML consumers purchasing homes from investors who acquired them from other creditors or investors would receive the protection of the additional appraisal requirement. It is unclear why HPML consumers in the latter case should receive these protections and consumers in the former case should not. In addition, the purpose of the additional appraisal requirement in the final rule is to ensure a second opinion on the value of a purchased home; the purpose of anti-flipping clauses generally is to restrict the transaction entirely. Thus, these clauses may be instructive, but should not necessarily determine who receives the protection of this rule.",
                        "If an exemption for HPMLs financing sales subject to an anti-flipping clause covered loans subject to anti-flipping clauses more generally, the Agencies would be concerned about more HPML consumers not receiving the protections of the statute. Moreover, if creditors were concerned that the additional appraisal requirement might impede disposal of their distressed properties, they could devise \u201canti-flipping\u201d clauses that would impose only minimal restrictions on the resale of those properties, simply to take advantage of the exemption. The Agencies recognize the importance to creditors and investors of being able to sell distressed properties in a timely manner to decrease losses. The Agencies further understand that restrictions on the resale of distressed properties purchased from creditors and investors can affect how quickly creditors and investors can dispose of these properties, and that creditors and investors design resale restrictions accordingly. However, the appraisal requirement under this final rule is not a restriction on resale by the seller; it is a requirement for additional documentation regarding the value of homes purchased by a certain subset of consumers who finance the transaction with an HPML.",
                        "The Agencies view the FHA Anti-Flipping Rules as also instructive for the final rule. In the preamble to its original Anti-Flipping Final Rule and waiver notices after it, HUD states that \u201cfraudulent property flipping involves the rapid re-sale, often within days, of a recently acquired property.\u201d\n        HUD also states in its original final rule that \u201cresales executed within 90 days imply pre-arranged transactions that often prove to be among the most egregious examples of predatory lending.\u201d\n        Thus, under existing HUD regulations, FHA insurance is not available for loans that finance the purchase of a property within 90 days of the previous sale. See 24 CFR 203.37a(b)(2). HUD's rule is based on the conclusion that 90 days is a reasonable waiting period to ensure that legitimate rehabilitation and repairs of a property have occurred.\n      ",
                        "HUD has also stated that a 180-day ban on eligibility for FHA insurance would have provided a disincentive to legitimate contractors who improve houses\u2014thus increasing the stock of affordable housing.\n        Therefore, for transactions involving resales in the 91-180 day period, HUD will insure resales at any price, but requires additional documentation, which must include a second appraisal, if the price increase exceeds the seller's acquisition price by 100 percent. See 24 CFR 203.37a(b)(3).",
                        "The Agencies believe that HUD's basic approach\u2014the use of more restrictive conditions for 90 days, followed by somewhat lesser restrictions for the next 90 days\u2014has merit as an approach to combatting the kind of flipping with which Congress seemed concerned.\n        The Agencies recognize that, since issuing the regulation in 24 CFR 203.37a(b)(3), HUD has issued rules that temporarily replace its existing regulations, with the goal of encouraging investors to rehabilitate homes and thus help \u201cstabilize real estate prices as well as neighborhoods and communities where foreclosure activity has been high.\u201d\n        Under these temporary rules, FHA insurance is now available for loans that finance property resales within 90 days of the previous sale, as long as certain conditions are met. One condition is that \u201ca second appraisal and/or supporting documentation\u201d is required if the sales price exceeds the seller's acquisition price by more than 20 percent.\n        However, the Agencies recognize that these rules are designed to address a temporary market condition; the Agencies believe that the HPML appraisal rules must be designed to address property flipping beyond a temporary market condition.",
                        "At the same time, the Agencies believe that the approach adopted with respect to the additional appraisal requirement resembles the FHA waiver rules in some important ways that mitigate concerns about chilling investment. Like the FHA waiver rules, the final rule does not prohibit HPML financing of resales within 90 days (by contrast, the existing FHA regulations ban FHA insurance on resales within 90 days). Rather, the final rule imposes an additional condition on the transaction\u2014namely, that the creditor must obtain a second appraisal for the creditor's use in considering the loan application and, more specifically, the collateral value of the dwelling that will secure the mortgage. The Agencies believe that this protection is consistent with congressional intent to provide additional protections for borrowers of loans considered by Congress to pose higher risks to those borrowers. Consistent with the views expressed by some commenters, however, the Agencies have determined that consumer protection is not served by requiring a second appraisal in circumstances where the increase generally is not indicative of a seller attempting to profit on a flip. The Agencies believe it is reasonable to expect a seller, faced with circumstances dictating resale of a dwelling that the seller very recently acquired, to seek to recoup the seller's transaction costs on the purchase and resale, in addition to the seller's acquisition price. These costs may include fees from the seller's acquisition, such as mortgage application fees, origination points, escrow and attorney's fees, transfer taxes and recording fees, title search charges and title insurance premiums, as well as fees incurred in the resale, such as real estate commissions, seller-paid points, and other sales concessions on the resale. These costs will vary to some extent by State and by transaction. However, the Agencies believe that providing an allowance of 10 percent over the seller's acquisition price reasonably accommodates these transaction costs and strikes an appropriate balance with respect to ease of administration for purposes of the rule.",
                        "Regarding HPMLs that occur within 91 to 180 days, the final rule provides that an additional appraisal is required only if the property price increased by more than 20 percent of the seller's acquisition price. See \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(B). In this way, the final rule provides a modest additional 10 percent allowance for legitimate repairs, and builds in a 90-day period in the interest of ensuring enough time to allow such repairs to be made. At the same time, the approach preserves added consumer protections in the first 90 days, when predatory flipping is most likely to occur. The Agencies recognize that this element of the final rule differs from the FHA Anti-Flipping Rules, which require additional documentation for a resale from 91 to 180 days only if the price increases by 100 percent of the seller's acquisition price. However, FHA insurance applies to HPMLs and non-HPMLs alike, and the Agencies believe that Congress intended special protections to apply to HPML consumers.",
                        "The Agencies believe that requiring an additional appraisal for HPMLs financing the purchase of a home being resold within a 180-day period, regardless of the amount of the price increase, could restrict home sales to HPML consumers, because investors might be less likely to sell properties to them. The additional appraisal rules could potentially affect the safety and soundness of creditors holding properties as a result of foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. This might arise if potential application of the two-appraisal requirement makes the properties less desirable for investors to purchase from financial institutions and rehabilitate for resale, out of investor concerns about the potential scope of the HPML requirement as applied to the pool of likely purchasers for their investment properties. This could create additional losses for creditors holding these properties. The Agencies do not believe that these potential negative impacts would be outweighed by consumer protections afforded by the additional appraisal requirement. The Agencies believe that the approach adopted by the final rule strikes the appropriate balance between allowing legitimate resales without undue restrictions and providing HPML consumers with additional protections from fraudulent flipping. For these reasons, the Agencies have concluded that the exemptions from the additional appraisal requirement reflected in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B) are in the public interest and promote the safety and soundness of creditors."

A GSE suggested that the Agencies exempt from the second appraisal requirement sales that are subject to an \u201canti-flipping\u201d clause. When an investor purchases a property in short sales from the GSEs, for example, certain clauses in the sales contract prohibit the investor from reselling that property for the first 30 days after the short sale purchase. The investor is then prohibited from reselling the property without justification and permission from the GSE for the next 31 to 90 days for a price that exceeds the seller's price by more than 20 percent.\n        Identical resale restrictions apply to investors purchasing property through a short sale under the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) program.\n        Some commenters suggested that the Agencies incorporate FHA's regime as the standard for the higher-risk mortgage rule."

                        "As noted, the Agencies are adopting a tiered approach to the proposed exemption from the additional appraisal requirement of TILA section \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(i) for HPMLs that finance the resale of properties that do not exceed certain price increases from the prior sale. Specifically, \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) exempts from the additional appraisal requirement HPMLs that finance the consumer's purchase of a property within 90 days of the seller's acquisition of the property where the resale price does not exceed 10 percent of the seller's acquisition price. Section 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(B), exempts from the additional appraisal requirement HPMLs that finance the consumer's purchase of a property within 91 to 180 days of the seller's acquisition of the property where the resale price does not exceed 20 percent of the seller's acquisition price. In developing this approach, the Agencies reviewed public comments as well as other government standards and rules designed to curb harmful flipping in residential mortgage transactions. These included short sale reselling restrictions imposed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Treasury Department,\n        as well as HUD's Anti-Flipping Rules\u2014both HUD's existing regulations (24 CFR 203.37a(b)) and HUD rules currently in effect that temporarily \u201cwaive\u201d existing regulations and replace them with other standards.\n      ",
                        "The Agencies believe that short sale reselling restrictions of the GSEs and Treasury are instructive. Like these rules, the final rule incorporates a bifurcated approach to addressing fraudulent flipping, based on the number of days between the seller's purchase and the consumer's purchase.\n        The Agencies are not adopting an exemption for HPMLs financing sales subject to an anti-flipping clause, however. The Agencies are concerned that such an exemption would not be sufficiently protective of the HPML consumers the statute was intended to protect. If such an exemption covered only loans subject to GSE and Treasury anti-flipping clauses, HPML consumers purchasing homes from investors who acquired them from GSEs or Treasury would not receive the protection of the additional appraisal requirement. Meanwhile, HPML consumers purchasing homes from investors who acquired them from other creditors or investors would receive the protection of the additional appraisal requirement. It is unclear why HPML consumers in the latter case should receive these protections and consumers in the former case should not. In addition, the purpose of the additional appraisal requirement in the final rule is to ensure a second opinion on the value of a purchased home; the purpose of anti-flipping clauses generally is to restrict the transaction entirely. Thus, these clauses may be instructive, but should not necessarily determine who receives the protection of this rule.",
                        "If an exemption for HPMLs financing sales subject to an anti-flipping clause covered loans subject to anti-flipping clauses more generally, the Agencies would be concerned about more HPML consumers not receiving the protections of the statute. Moreover, if creditors were concerned that the additional appraisal requirement might impede disposal of their distressed properties, they could devise \u201canti-flipping\u201d clauses that would impose only minimal restrictions on the resale of those properties, simply to take advantage of the exemption. The Agencies recognize the importance to creditors and investors of being able to sell distressed properties in a timely manner to decrease losses. The Agencies further understand that restrictions on the resale of distressed properties purchased from creditors and investors can affect how quickly creditors and investors can dispose of these properties, and that creditors and investors design resale restrictions accordingly. However, the appraisal requirement under this final rule is not a restriction on resale by the seller; it is a requirement for additional documentation regarding the value of homes purchased by a certain subset of consumers who finance the transaction with an HPML.",
                        "The Agencies view the FHA Anti-Flipping Rules as also instructive for the final rule. In the preamble to its original Anti-Flipping Final Rule and waiver notices after it, HUD states that \u201cfraudulent property flipping involves the rapid re-sale, often within days, of a recently acquired property.\u201d\n        HUD also states in its original final rule that \u201cresales executed within 90 days imply pre-arranged transactions that often prove to be among the most egregious examples of predatory lending.\u201d\n        Thus, under existing HUD regulations, FHA insurance is not available for loans that finance the purchase of a property within 90 days of the previous sale. See 24 CFR 203.37a(b)(2). HUD's rule is based on the conclusion that 90 days is a reasonable waiting period to ensure that legitimate rehabilitation and repairs of a property have occurred.\n      ",
                        "HUD has also stated that a 180-day ban on eligibility for FHA insurance would have provided a disincentive to legitimate contractors who improve houses\u2014thus increasing the stock of affordable housing.\n        Therefore, for transactions involving resales in the 91-180 day period, HUD will insure resales at any price, but requires additional documentation, which must include a second appraisal, if the price increase exceeds the seller's acquisition price by 100 percent. See 24 CFR 203.37a(b)(3).",
                        "The Agencies believe that HUD's basic approach\u2014the use of more restrictive conditions for 90 days, followed by somewhat lesser restrictions for the next 90 days\u2014has merit as an approach to combatting the kind of flipping with which Congress seemed concerned.\n        The Agencies recognize that, since issuing the regulation in 24 CFR 203.37a(b)(3), HUD has issued rules that temporarily replace its existing regulations, with the goal of encouraging investors to rehabilitate homes and thus help \u201cstabilize real estate prices as well as neighborhoods and communities where foreclosure activity has been high.\u201d\n        Under these temporary rules, FHA insurance is now available for loans that finance property resales within 90 days of the previous sale, as long as certain conditions are met. One condition is that \u201ca second appraisal and/or supporting documentation\u201d is required if the sales price exceeds the seller's acquisition price by more than 20 percent.\n        However, the Agencies recognize that these rules are designed to address a temporary market condition; the Agencies believe that the HPML appraisal rules must be designed to address property flipping beyond a temporary market condition.",
                        "At the same time, the Agencies believe that the approach adopted with respect to the additional appraisal requirement resembles the FHA waiver rules in some important ways that mitigate concerns about chilling investment. Like the FHA waiver rules, the final rule does not prohibit HPML financing of resales within 90 days (by contrast, the existing FHA regulations ban FHA insurance on resales within 90 days). Rather, the final rule imposes an additional condition on the transaction\u2014namely, that the creditor must obtain a second appraisal for the creditor's use in considering the loan application and, more specifically, the collateral value of the dwelling that will secure the mortgage. The Agencies believe that this protection is consistent with congressional intent to provide additional protections for borrowers of loans considered by Congress to pose higher risks to those borrowers. Consistent with the views expressed by some commenters, however, the Agencies have determined that consumer protection is not served by requiring a second appraisal in circumstances where the increase generally is not indicative of a seller attempting to profit on a flip. The Agencies believe it is reasonable to expect a seller, faced with circumstances dictating resale of a dwelling that the seller very recently acquired, to seek to recoup the seller's transaction costs on the purchase and resale, in addition to the seller's acquisition price. These costs may include fees from the seller's acquisition, such as mortgage application fees, origination points, escrow and attorney's fees, transfer taxes and recording fees, title search charges and title insurance premiums, as well as fees incurred in the resale, such as real estate commissions, seller-paid points, and other sales concessions on the resale. These costs will vary to some extent by State and by transaction. However, the Agencies believe that providing an allowance of 10 percent over the seller's acquisition price reasonably accommodates these transaction costs and strikes an appropriate balance with respect to ease of administration for purposes of the rule.",
                        "Regarding HPMLs that occur within 91 to 180 days, the final rule provides that an additional appraisal is required only if the property price increased by more than 20 percent of the seller's acquisition price. See \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(B). In this way, the final rule provides a modest additional 10 percent allowance for legitimate repairs, and builds in a 90-day period in the interest of ensuring enough time to allow such repairs to be made. At the same time, the approach preserves added consumer protections in the first 90 days, when predatory flipping is most likely to occur. The Agencies recognize that this element of the final rule differs from the FHA Anti-Flipping Rules, which require additional documentation for a resale from 91 to 180 days only if the price increases by 100 percent of the seller's acquisition price. However, FHA insurance applies to HPMLs and non-HPMLs alike, and the Agencies believe that Congress intended special protections to apply to HPML consumers.",
                        "The Agencies believe that requiring an additional appraisal for HPMLs financing the purchase of a home being resold within a 180-day period, regardless of the amount of the price increase, could restrict home sales to HPML consumers, because investors might be less likely to sell properties to them. The additional appraisal rules could potentially affect the safety and soundness of creditors holding properties as a result of foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. This might arise if potential application of the two-appraisal requirement makes the properties less desirable for investors to purchase from financial institutions and rehabilitate for resale, out of investor concerns about the potential scope of the HPML requirement as applied to the pool of likely purchasers for their investment properties. This could create additional losses for creditors holding these properties. The Agencies do not believe that these potential negative impacts would be outweighed by consumer protections afforded by the additional appraisal requirement. The Agencies believe that the approach adopted by the final rule strikes the appropriate balance between allowing legitimate resales without undue restrictions and providing HPML consumers with additional protections from fraudulent flipping. For these reasons, the Agencies have concluded that the exemptions from the additional appraisal requirement reflected in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B) are in the public interest and promote the safety and soundness of creditors."

Commenters favoring this approach suggested that allowing a creditor to use a single appraisal firm or AMC would reduce costs, ease compliance burdens, and mitigate concerns regarding the availability of appraisers, particularly in rural or sparsely populated areas. Several commenters noted that the use of a single appraisal firm or AMC would not weaken the different appraiser requirement since each appraisal is subject to USPAP and appraisal independence requirements. One commenter, however, stated the rule should prohibit a creditor from hiring appraisers from the same valuation firm and, with respect to AMCs, a creditor should be prohibited from hiring two appraisers through the same AMC if the AMC is an affiliate of the creditor."

The Agencies are also adopting new comment 35(c)(4)(ii)-1, clarifying that the requirements that a creditor obtain two separate appraisals (\u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(i)), and that each appraisal be conducted by a \u201cdifferent\u201d licensed or certified appraiser (\u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(ii)), indicate that the two appraisals must be conducted independently of each other. The comment explains that, if the two certified or licensed appraisers are affiliated, such as by being employed by the same appraisal firm, then whether they have conducted the appraisal independently of each other must be determined based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case known to the creditor.",
                        "As discussed in the proposal, the Agencies believe that the appraisal independence requirements of TILA (implemented at \u00a7 1026.42) help ensure that the two appraisals reflect valuation judgments that are independent of the creditor's loan origination interests and not biased by an appraiser's personal or business interest in the property or the transaction. TILA section 129E, 15 U.S.C. 1639e. In addition, FIRREA title XI includes rules to ensure that appraisers exercise their independent judgment in conducting appraisals, such as requirements that federally-regulated depositories separate appraisers from the lending, investment, and collection functions of the institution, and that the appraiser have \u201cno direct or indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the property.\u201d\n        As noted, USPAP's Ethics Rule, which applies to appraisers, also requires that appraisers \u201cperform assignments with impartiality, objectivity, and independence, and without accommodation of personal interests,\u201d and includes several examples of prohibited conduct related to this rule.\n        As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.35(c)(1)(a), compliance with USPAP is a condition of being a \u201ccertified or licensed appraiser\u201d under TILA's \u201chigher-risk mortgage\u201d appraisal rules implemented in this final rule. TILA section 129H(b)(3), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(3); \u00a7 1026.35(c)(1)(a).",
                        "Requirements for valuation independence for consumer credit transactions secured by the consumer's principal dwelling were adopted under amendments to TILA in the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 and have been in effect since April of 2011. See 12 CFR 1026.42; 75 FR 66554 (Oct. 28, 2010), implementing TILA section 129E, 15 U.S.C. 1639e. The requirements in TILA, which carry civil liability, were designed to ensure that real estate appraisals used to support creditors' underwriting decisions are based on the appraiser's independent professional judgment, free of any influence or pressure that may be exerted by parties that have an interest in the transaction.",
                        "Existing appraisal independence requirements expressly prohibit appraisers, AMCs, or appraisal firms (all providers of settlement services) from having an interest in the property or transaction or from causing the value assigned to a consumer's principal dwelling to be based on any factor other than the independent judgment of the person preparing the appraisal. Material misstatements of the value are also prohibited for these parties, as is having a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, which prohibits these parties from being compensated based on the outcome of the transaction.",
                        "The Agencies understand that, in light of these rules, a principal reason that creditors contract with third-party AMCs and appraisal firms is to ensure that the appraisal function is independent from the loan origination function, as required by law. In addition, the creditor remains responsible for compliance with the appraisal requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(c), and both the creditor and the creditor's third party agent risk liability for violations of TILA's appraisal independence requirements.",
                        "At the same time, the Agencies have concerns about whether the unbiased appraiser independence will always be fully realized if, for example, the two appraisals are performed by appraisers employed by the same company. The Agencies recognize that in some cases, obtaining two appraisals from different appraisal firms might not be feasible, and moreover that appraisers working for the same company are cognizant of their independence, and indeed might not even interact at all. Thus, the rule is intended to allow flexibility in ordering the two appraisals from the same entity. However, as underscored in comment 35(c)(4)(ii)-1, in all cases the two appraisers should function independently of each other to ensure that in fact two separate and independent judgments of the property value are reflected in the required appraisals. If the creditor knows of facts or circumstances about the performance of the additional appraisal by the same firm indicating that the additional appraisal was not performed independently, the creditor should refrain from extending credit, unless the creditor obtains another appraisal."

See new \u00a7 1026.35(c)(3)(i). The Agencies expressed in the proposal the belief that this approach best effectuates the purposes of the statute. TILA section 129H(b)(1) provides that, \u201c[s]ubject to the rules prescribed under paragraph (4), an appraisal of property to be secured by a higher-risk mortgage does not meet the requirements of this section unless it is performed by a certified or licensed appraiser who conducts a physical property visit of the interior of the mortgaged property.\u201d 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(1). The \u201csecond appraisal\u201d required under TILA section 129H(b)(2)(A) is \u201can appraisal of property to be secured by a higher-risk mortgage\u201d under TILA section 129H(b)(1). 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(1), (b)(2)(A). Therefore, to meet the requirements of TILA section 129H, the additional appraisal would be required to be \u201cperformed by a certified or licensed appraiser who conducts a physical visit of the interior of the property that will secure the transaction.\u201d TILA section 129H(b)(1), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(1).",

The Agencies believe that the purposes of the statute would be best implemented by requiring the second appraiser to perform a physical interior property visit to analyze any improvements made to the property. Without an on-site visit, the second appraiser would have difficulty confirming that any improvements identified by the seller or the first appraiser were made.",

In response to some commenters who expressed confusion about whether the creditor could rely on the safe harbor under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(3)(ii) in satisfying the general appraisal requirements under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(3)(i) for the additional appraisal, the Agencies are adopting a new comment. New comment 35(c)(4)(iii)-1 clarifies that when a creditor is required to obtain an additional appraisal under \u00a7 1026(c)(4)(i), the creditor must comply with the requirements of both \u00a7 1026.35(c)(3)(i) and \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(ii)-(v) for that appraisal. If the creditor meets the safe harbor criteria in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(3)(ii) for the additional appraisal, the creditor complies with the requirements of \u00a7 1026.35(c)(3)(i) for that appraisal."

This exemption generally corresponds with an exemption from the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule for loans financing the purchase of properties sold by State- and Federally-chartered financial institutions and GSEs (see 12 CFR 203.37a(c)(6)). The Agencies recognize that this exemption might overlap with the exemption in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(A) for sales by government agencies, which might sell properties that the agencies acquire in connection with liquidating a mortgage. However, the Agencies believe that a separate exemption for sales by government agencies is advisable because government agencies might have other reasons for acquiring a property that they then determined was advisable to sell, such as property acquired through exercise of the government's eminent domain powers.",

First, holders of the mortgages might be forced to hold properties after foreclosure longer than is financially optimal, increasing losses; some public commenters indicated that waiting six months so that the additional appraisal requirement would not apply would be far too long. Second, holders who want or need to clear these properties off of their books might be forced to accept lower prices offered by investors, which would also increase losses. When the holder in this situation is a creditor such as a bank or other financial institution, increased losses can have a negative effect on its safety and soundness. Third, incentives for investors to buy and rehabilitate properties could be reduced, which could be counterproductive to community development and the revitalization of the housing market. Finally, more consumers might have to forego opportunities for homeownership.",

For example, as with the exemption for HPMLs financing the sale of a property by an employer or relocation agency in connection with the relocation of an employee, the exemption for HPMLs financing the sale of a property by a servicemember with permanent relocation orders facilitates the efficient transfer of servicemembers.",
                        "Without this exemption, servicemembers might have more limited options for eligible buyers. For reasons discussed earlier, some creditors might be reticent about lending to an HPML consumer in a transaction that would trigger the additional appraisal requirement. This could result in servicemembers being forced to retain mortgages that are difficult for them to afford when they must also support themselves and their families in a new living arrangement elsewhere. In turn, the positions of creditors and investors on those existing mortgages could be compromised by servicemembers not being able to meet their mortgage obligations.",
                        "The Agencies do not believe that this exemption would be used frequently. Regardless, the Agencies believe that an exemption for HPMLs financing the purchase of the property in that instance is in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors."

These UICs correspond to areas outside of MSAs as well as most micropolitan statistical areas; the definition would also include properties located in micropolitan statistical areas that are not adjacent to an MSA. This rural county exemption is not an exemption in the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule. However, the Agencies received requests to consider an exemption for loans in rural areas during informal outreach for the proposal, as well as from public commenters.",
                        "In the proposal, the Agencies did not propose an exemption for loans secured by properties in \u201crural\u201d areas from all of the Dodd-Frank Act \u201chigher-risk mortgage\u201d appraisal rules, but requested comment on an exemption for these loans from the additional appraisal requirement. As discussed earlier, commenters widely supported an exemption for loans secured by properties in rural areas, citing several reasons: a lack of appraisers; the disproportionate cost of an extra appraisal, based on commenters' view that property values tend to be lower in rural areas than in non-rural areas; the assertion that many lenders in rural areas hold the loans in portfolio and therefore are more mindful of ensuring that properties securing their loans are valued properly; the assertion that lenders in rural areas tend to need to price loans higher for legitimate reasons, so a disproportionate amount of their loans (compared to those of larger lenders) will be subject to the appraisal rules and thus these lenders will bear an unfair burden that they are less equipped than larger lenders to bear; and the assertion that property flipping is rare in rural areas.",
                        "The analysis in the proposal of the impact of the proposed rule in rural areas corroborated commenters' concern that a larger share of loans in rural areas tend to be HPMLs than in non-rural areas.\n        Although many small and rural lenders are excluded from HMDA reporting, tabulations of rural loans by HMDA reporters may be informative about patterns of rural HPML usage. As conveyed in the proposal, 10 percent of rural first-lien purchase-money loans were HPMLs in 2010 compared to 3 percent of non-rural first-lien purchase loans.\n        Based on this information, the Bureau concluded that rural borrowers may be more likely to incur the cost of an additional appraisal requirement than non-rural consumers.",
                        "Regarding appraiser availability, analysis conducted for the proposal indicated that more than two appraisers are located in all but 22 counties nationwide (13 of which are in Alaska).\n        An appraiser was considered \u201clocated\u201d in a county if the appraiser's home or business address listed on the Appraisal Subcommittee's National Appraiser Registry was in that county. Public commenters pointed out, however, that while many rural areas might have more than two appraisers, these few appraisers are often busy and not readily available. One reason may be that many rural counties cover large areas, perhaps making it more difficult to arrange timely appraisals in such areas. As noted, a financial holding company suggested that the final rule exempt lenders located in areas where the State appraiser licensing or certification roster shows five or fewer unaffiliated appraisers within a reasonable distance, such as 50 miles or less. A large bank further recommended that the final rule exempt loans secured by properties in low-density appraiser markets, such as states with fewer than 500 appraisers or counties with fewer than five appraisers. The final rule does not adopt an exemption based on the number of appraisers within a particular geographic area or radius of the property securing the HPML. The Agencies believe that a simpler approach is consistent with the objectives of the statute, facilitates compliance, and reduces burden on creditors.",
                        "Other than the commenters who suggested a \u201cradius\u201d or low-density approach for the rural exemption, only one other commenter offered suggestions on how to define rural. This commenter recommended that the Agencies adopt a definition of \u201crural\u201d that is consistent with the definition used in rules addressing the use of escrow accounts. See 2013 Escrows Final Rule, \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv); see also 2013 ATR Final Rule, \u00a7 1026.43(f)(2)(vi) and comment 43(f)(2)(vi-1). The Agencies specifically requested comment on whether the definition of \u201crural\u201d used in any exemption adopted should be the same as the definition in the 2011 ATR Proposal and 2011 Escrows Proposal. These exemptions are described below.",

                        "As discussed in more detail in the 2013 ATR Final Rule and 2013 Escrows Final Rule, most commenters on the proposals for those rulemakings objected to this definition of \u201crural\u201d as too narrow (it covers approximately 2 percent of the U.S. population). The narrow scope of the definition of \u201crural\u201d was viewed as especially onerous because the scope was narrowed even further by a number of additional conditions on the exemption imposed by the statute.\n        As explained more fully in the 2013 ATR Final Rule and 2013 Escrows Final Rule, the Bureau is finalizing a more broad definition of \u201crural,\u201d acknowledging that the exemption will nonetheless be narrowed by the additional conditions.",
                        "The Bureau is defining \u201crural\u201d as UICs 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12. These codes comprise all areas outside of MSAs and outside of all micropolitan statistical areas except micropolitan statistical areas that are not adjacent to MSAs. According to current U.S. Census data, approximately 10 percent of the U.S. population lives in these areas.",
                        "Exemption for HPMLs secured by properties in rural counties from the additional appraisal requirement. The Agencies believe that the definition of \u201crural\u201d county used by the Bureau is appropriate for the exemption from the requirement to obtain an additional appraisal under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(i) for loans in rural areas. In addition, the Agencies view consistency across mortgage rules in defining rural county as desirable for compliance and enforcement. Thus, the exemption in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H) cross-references the definition of rural county in the HPML escrow provisions of revised \u00a7 1026.35(b) (see 2013 Escrows Final Rule, \u00a7 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)). (The same definition of rural county is adopted by the Bureau in the 2013 ATR Final rule, \u00a7 1026.43(f)(2)(vi) and comment 43(f)(2)(vi-1).) The Agencies have considered several factors in determining how to define the scope of the exemption.",
                        "First, the Agencies believe that creditors must be readily able to determine whether a particular transaction qualifies for the exemption. This will be possible because the Bureau will annually publish on its Web site a table of the counties in which properties would qualify for this exemption. Comment 35(c)(4)(vii)(H)-1 cross-references comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1, which clarifies that the Bureau will publish on its Web site the applicable table of counties for each calendar year by the end of that calendar year. The comment further clarifies that a property securing an HPML subject to \u00a7 1026.35(c) is in a rural county under \u00a7 1026(c)(4)(vii)(H) if the county in which the property is located is on the table of rural counties most recently published by the Bureau. The comment provides the following example: for a transaction occurring in 2015, assume that the Bureau most recently published a table of rural counties at the end of 2014. The property securing the transaction would be located in a rural county for purposes of \u00a7 1026(c)(4)(vii)(H) if the county is on the table of rural counties published by the Bureau at the end of 2014. The Agencies anticipate that loan officers and others will be able to look on the Bureau Web site to identify whether the county in which the subject property is located is on the list.",
                        "Second, the Agencies endeavored to create an exemption tailored to address key concerns raised by commenters requesting a rural exemption, based on data findings by the Agencies. The principal concerns that the Agencies identified among commenters were that: first, adequate numbers of appraisers might not be available in rural areas for creditors to comply with the additional appraisal requirement and; second, the cost of obtaining the additional appraisal might deter some creditors from making HPMLs in these areas, many of which might already be underserved, reducing credit access for rural consumers. As noted in the proposed rule and discussed below, the potential reduction in credit access might be disproportionally greater in rural areas than in non-rural areas because the proportion of HPMLs is higher in rural as opposed to non-rural areas.",
                        "For the reasons explained below, the Agencies believe that the exemption for loans in rural areas as defined in the final rule is appropriately tailored to address these and related concerns. By better ensuring credit access and lowering costs among creditors extending HPMLs in rural areas, including small community banks, the exemption is expected to benefit the public and promote the safety and soundness of creditors. See TILA section 129H(b)(4)(B), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(4)(B).",
                        "Appraiser availability. As noted, commenters indicated that in some rural areas it can be difficult to find appraisers who are both competent to appraise a particular rural property and also readily available. The cost-benefit analysis conducted by the Bureau for the proposal focused in part on estimating appraiser availability in particular areas and identified counties in which fewer than two appraisers with requisite credentials indicated having a business or home address.\n        However, commenters noted and the Agencies confirmed based on additional outreach for this final rule that not all appraisers whose home or business address is in a particular geographic area are competent to appraise properties in that area. Thus, to inform the final rule, the Bureau expanded its research from that conducted for the proposal.",
                        "For the final rule, the Bureau computed how many appraisers showed that they had a home or business address within a 50-mile radius of the center of each census tract in which an HPML loan was reported in the 2011 HMDA data.\n        The 50-mile radius test was intended to be a proxy for the potential service area for an appraiser in a more rural area and would cover properties located in roughly an hour's drive of an appraiser's home or office location.",
                        "On this basis, the Bureau found that, of 262,989 HMDA-reported HPMLs in 2011, 603 had fewer than five appraisers within a 50-mile radius of the center of the tract in which the securing property was located; 484 of these loans were in areas covered by the final rule's rural exclusion. Based on FHFA data, the Bureau estimates that 5 percent of these HPMLs were potentially covered by the statute's additional appraisal requirement because they were purchase-money HPMLs secured by properties sold within a 180-day window.\n        A lower proportion would have been flips with a price increase. See TILA section 129H(b)(2)(A), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2)(A). But taking solely the number of flips without regard to price increase or other exemptions (see \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2) and (c)(4)(vii)), an estimated 30 HPML transactions that were flips had fewer than five appraisers within a 50-mile radius of the center of the census tract in which they were located (5 percent of 603 HPMLs). Twenty-four of these would have been covered by the rural exemption as defined in the final rule (5 percent of 484 HPMLs).",
                        "On this basis, the Agencies have concluded that the exemption is reasonably tailored to exclude from coverage of the additional appraisal requirement the loans for which appraiser availability might be an issue.",
                        "Credit access. Commenters also raised concerns about credit access, emphasizing that a larger proportion of loans in rural areas are HPMLs than in non-rural areas. Commenters suggested that the additional appraisal requirement could deter some creditors from extending HPML credit. See \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(v) and corresponding section-by-section analysis.",
                        "The additional appraisal requirement entails several compliance steps. After identifying that a loan is an HPML under \u00a7 1026.35(a), a creditor will need to assess whether the HPML is exempt from the appraisal requirements entirely under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2). If the loan is not exempt as a qualified mortgage or other type of transaction exempt under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2), the creditor will need to determine whether the HPML is one of the transactions that is exempt from the additional appraisal requirement under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(vii). If the HPML is not exempt from the additional appraisal requirement, the creditor will need to determine whether the requirement to obtain an additional appraisal is triggered based on the date and, if necessary, price of the seller's acquisition of the property securing the HPML. See \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B). (Alternatively, the creditor could assume that the requirement applies and order two appraisals without taking each of these steps.) If the requirement is triggered, the creditor must obtain an additional appraisal performed by a certified or licensed appraiser, the cost of which cannot be charged to the consumer. See id. and \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(v).",
                        "If these compliance obligations would deter some creditors from extending HPMLs, the impact on credit access might be greater in rural areas as defined in the final rule than in non-rural areas, because a significantly larger proportion of residential mortgage loans made in rural areas are HPMLs than in non-rural areas. Again, based on 2011 HMDA data, 12 percent of rural first-lien, purchase-money loans were HPMLs compared to four percent of non-rural first-lien, purchase-money loan.\n        That is, recent data indicates that HPMLs occur three times as often in the rural setting.",
                        "Thus, an important consideration for the Agencies in determining the scope of the exemption was the comparative number of creditors extending HPMLs in various geographic areas. To this end, the Agencies considered, based on HMDA data, the number of creditors reported to have extended HPML credit in the geographic units defined by the 12 UICs. (For more details, see the Section 1022(b)(2) cost-benefit analysis in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION below.) The Agencies believe that in the areas with a greater number of lenders reporting that they extended HPMLs, the additional appraisal requirement will have a lower impact on credit access.",
                        "HMDA data for 2011 show that a sharp drop-off in the number of creditors reporting to extend HPML credit occurs in micropolitan statistical areas not adjacent to MSAs (UIC 8), compared to MSAs and micropolitan statistical areas that are adjacent to MSAs.\n        Specifically, 10 creditors reported that they extended HPMLs in a median county classified as UIC 8 in 2011; by contrast, in the median counties of the UICs with the next highest populations (UICs 2, 3, 5), the number of creditors reporting that they extended HPMLs was 24, 18, and 16, respectively. The drop-off in numbers of HPML creditors continues for UICs representing non-MSAs and non-micropolitan statistical areas.",
                        "The Agencies also looked at the estimated number of flips in areas encompassed by the rural exemption of the final rule to determine whether the consumer protections lost might outweigh the benefits of the exemption. As explained in greater detail in the Section 1022(b)(2) analysis, the Bureau estimates that, based on HMDA data, 122,806 purchase-money HPMLs were made in 2011; 21,370 of those were in the areas covered by the rural exclusion. As noted, the Bureau estimates that the proportion of purchase-money HPMLs involving properties sold within 180 days is 5 percent.\n        Thus, of HPMLs in rural counties as defined in the final rule, an estimated 5 percent would have been flips. This number does not account for any other exemptions from the HPML appraisal rules that might apply to these HPMLs under \u00a7 1026.35(c)(2) or (c)(4)(vii). It also does not account for the price increase thresholds defining a transaction covered under the additional appraisal requirement in this final rule. See \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B) and corresponding section-by-section analysis.",
                        "The Agencies believe that the exemption for HPMLs secured by rural properties appropriately balances credit access and consumer protection. As the data above suggests, the estimated number of HPML consumers that would not receive the protections of an additional appraisal due to this exemption is very small. Moreover, the Agencies note that affected HPML consumers would still receive the consumer protections afforded by the general requirement for an interior-inspection appraisal performed by a certified or licensed appraiser. See \u00a7 1026.35(c)(3)(i).",
                        "In sum, the Agencies believe that the exemption in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(G) will help ensure that creditors in rural areas are able to extend HPML credit without undue burden, which will in turn mitigate any detrimental impacts on access to credit in rural areas that might result absent the exemption. The Agencies further believe that the exemption is appropriately tailored to ensure that needed consumer protections regarding appraisals are in place in areas where they are needed. For all of the reasons explained above, the Agencies have concluded that the exemption in \u00a7 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H) is in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors."

Several commenters opposed requiring two appraisals under any circumstances. However, the Agencies note that the additional appraisal requirement is mandated by statute. TILA section 129H(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2). Commenters in general strongly supported an exemption for loans made in rural areas. The commenters stated that there are limited numbers of licensed and certified appraisers in rural areas, which would make the additional appraisal requirement (requiring appraisals by two independent appraisers) particularly burdensome in these areas. In addition, commenters argued that lenders in rural areas may be forced to hire appraisers from far outside the geographic area, which would increase the time and cost associated with the transaction. Several commenters also stated that rural areas have not historically been sources of fraudulent real estate flipping activity. A number of commenters noted that property prices in rural areas tend to be lower, so the cost of the second appraisal is higher as a percentage of the overall transaction. Two commenters, national trade associations for appraisers, opposed the exemption for rural loans, suggesting that it is not difficult to find two appraisers to value rural properties.",

See 2011 Escrows Proposal, discussed below, revised and adopted in the 2013 Escrows Final Rule.\n        Another commenter, a financial holding company, suggested that the final rule exempt lenders located in areas where the State appraiser licensing or certification roster shows five or fewer unaffiliated appraisers within a reasonable distance, such as 50 miles or less. A large bank further recommended that the final rule exempt loans secured by properties in low-density appraiser markets, such as states with fewer than 500 appraisers or counties with fewer than five appraisers.",

                        "\u2022 One of the banks asserted that it would be difficult for a creditor to comply with a deadline for the notice that is any earlier than the TILA GFE disclosure deadline, because the rate and therefore \u201chigher-risk mortgage\u201d status of a loan is not typically known earlier.

Two banks, a credit union trade association at the State level, and a service provider supported including a method in the rule for a creditor to comply with the disclosure requirement if the loan is determined to be an HPML after the time of application. For example, if the rate were not locked, HPML status could arise later in the application process when the rate is set. One large bank noted, however, that if the language in the notice under this rule is the same as in the ECOA notice, then there would be no need to allow this type of cure right for loans that are subject to ECOA (i.e., first-lien dwelling-secured HPMLs)."

The Agencies believe that the three-business-day timeframe in the proposed rule is a reasonable and appropriate interpretation of the statute. As noted, commenters generally supported a timeframe that would allow for including the notice in the proposed combined TILA-RESPA Loan Estimate, which would be provided within three business days after the application. No commenter suggested that the Agencies should mandate either an earlier or separate notice. Industry commenters correctly pointed out that the appraisal charge cannot be levied prior to the TILA GFE (and, as proposed, the TILA-RESPA Loan Estimate) being provided in any event. As a result, it appears unlikely that creditors would order appraisals before this time, so consumers would not appear to have a significant need to receive the appraisal notice either earlier or separately from the GFE or Loan Estimate. Adding new separate notices could increase the volume of information consumers receive, and potentially decrease consumer understanding.",

As one commenter noted, clarification may be needed on how a creditor could comply with the notice requirement when the loan becomes an HPML more than three days after application due to the higher-priced rate being set at a later date. As one commenter noted, this clarification would not be necessary for first-lien loans. ECOA, as implemented in Regulation B of the Bureau's 2013 ECOA Appraisals Final Rule, requires notice within three business days after application for all first-lien dwelling-secured loans, regardless of whether they are HPMLs. ECOA section 701(e)(5), 15 U.S.C. 1691(e)(5); 2013 ECOA Appraisals Final Rule \u00a7 1002.14(a)(1). Further, the HPML appraisal notice is integrated with the ECOA appraisal notice. See 2013 ECOA Appraisals Final Rule, \u00a7 1002.14(b) and appendix C, Form C-9. As the final rule makes clear, by complying with the ECOA notice requirement, the creditor would automatically comply with the HPML appraisal notice requirement, even if the creditor had not yet determined that the loan would be an HPML. Again, \u00a7 1026.35(c)(5)(i) provides that \u201c[c]ompliance with the disclosure requirement in Regulation B \u00a7 1002.14(a)(2) satisfies the requirements of [the HPML appraisal disclosure requirement of \u00a7 1026.35(c)(5)(i)].\u201d",

Thus, for subordinate-lien mortgage creditors, a rate increase that occurs more than three business days after application (i.e.,\n        after the required HPML appraisal rule disclosure should have been given) could trigger the HPML notice requirement. Accordingly, the Agencies are adopting additional regulation text providing that a creditor may issue the HPML appraisal notice within three business days of determining the rate."

Thus the Agencies are not able to implement the precise statutory exemption for \u201creverse mortgage loans that are qualified mortgages.\u201d Instead, the exemption for reverse mortgages is based on the Agencies' express authority to exempt from TILA's \u201chigher-risk mortgage\u201d appraisal rules \u201ca class of loans,\u201d if the exemption \u201cis in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors.\u201d TILA section 129H(b)(4)(B), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(4)(B).",

        "146":"The Bureau notes that, among other restrictions, the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule also includes in \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1) a prohibition on balloon payment features for most high-cost mortgages, and retains the current restrictions on high-cost mortgages permitting negative amortization. As noted, high-cost mortgages will be subject to these restrictions in addition to the requirements imposed in this final rule. With respect to prepayment penalty revisions, the Dodd-Frank Act deleted the statutory restrictions applicable to high-cost mortgages. The new Dodd-Frank Act prepayment penalty restrictions of section 1414 are implemented as discussed below.",
        "147":"The points and fees limit for qualified mortgages set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, as implemented in \u00a7 1026.43(e) of this final rule (including separate points and fees limits for smaller loans), is lower than the high-cost mortgage points and fees threshold. Thus, any loan that triggers the high-cost mortgage provisions through the points and fees criteria could not satisfy the qualified mortgage definition. Likewise, \u00a7 1026.43(g) of this final rule provides that, where qualified mortgages are permitted to have prepayment penalties, such penalties may not be imposed more than three years after consummation or in an amount that exceeds 2 percent of the amount prepaid. This limitation aligns with the prepayment penalty trigger for the high-cost mortgage provisions, such that a loan that satisfies the qualified mortgage requirements would never trigger the high-cost mortgage provisions as a result of a prepayment penalty.",
        "144":"These adjustments are consistent with the Bureau's authority under TILA section 129C(b)(3)(B)(i) to prescribe regulations that revise, add to, or subtract from the criteria that define a qualified mortgage upon a finding that such regulations are necessary or proper to ensure that responsible, affordable mortgage credit remains available to consumers in a manner consistent with the purposes of this section, necessary and appropriate to effectuate the purposes of TILA section 129B and section 129C, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance with such sections.",

The Board cited \u201csubstantial evidence that compensation based on loan rate or other terms is commonplace throughout the mortgage industry, as reflected in Federal agency settlement orders, congressional hearings, studies, and public proceedings.\u201d Id. Among the Board's stated concerns was that \u201ccreditor payments to brokers based on the interest rate give brokers an incentive to provide consumers loans with higher interest rates. Large numbers of consumers are simply not aware this incentive exists.\u201d 75 FR 58509, 58511 (Sept. 24, 2010). The Board adopted this prohibition based on its finding that compensating loan originators based on a loan's terms or conditions, other than the amount of credit extended, is an unfair practice that causes substantial injury to consumers. 75 FR 58509, 58520 (September 24, 2010).
