In the Small Business Review Panel Outline, the Bureau noted that its estimate was based on 2010 call report data, and revenue from loan originations was assumed to equal fee and interest income from 1-4 family residences as reported. The Bureau noted that to the extent that other revenue on the call reports is tied to loan originations, the numbers may be underestimated.

In the proposal, the Bureau also noted that for small depository institutions and credit unions (defined as those institutions with assets under $175 million), regulatory data from 2010 indicate that for small savings institutions whose primary business focus is on residential mortgages, 59 percent of these firms would be restricted from paying bonuses based on mortgage-related profits to their individual loan originators under the revenue test if set at 50 percent. The Bureau noted that it lacks comprehensive data on nonbank lenders and, in particular, does not have information regarding the precise range of business activities that such companies engage in, and as a result, it was unclear the extent to which such nonbank lenders will face restrictions on their compensation practices. 77 FR 55272, 55347 (Sept. 7, 2012).

        "113":"For similar reasons, the Bureau has also not made any changes to the proposal based on comments requesting the Bureau exempt certain institutions from the effect of \u00a7 1026.36(d), such as those with under $1 billion in assets and those that keep their loans in portfolio. The commenters provided little to no evidence about why they should be exempt and the factors that would mitigate the steering incentives this rule addresses.",
        "112":"As noted earlier, numerous questions by industry to the Board and the Bureau precipitated the Bureau issuing CFPB Bulletin 2012-2 and clarifying these issues in this rulemaking.",
        "82":"As discussed above, it is also not permissible to differentiate compensation based on credit product type, since products are simply a bundle of particular terms.",
        "83":"Commenters also requested clarification on whether compensation could vary based on whether an extension of credit was originated in wholesale or retail channels or whether credit was extended by a bank or the bank brokered the extension of credit to another creditor.

To the extent there is any uncertainty in the statute regarding whether loan originators are prohibited from being compensated based on a percentage of the loan that itself varies based on the amount of credit extended for a particular transaction, the Bureau relies on its interpretive authority under TILA section 105(a) to effectuate the purposes of TILA, prevent circumvention or evasion, and facilitate compliance therewith.",
        "86":"If a loan originator's compensation was calculated on an estimate of hours worked for a specific product, or by any other methodology to determine time worked other than accounting for actual hours worked, the methodology would be permissible only if it did not meet the definition of a proxy (and complied with other applicable laws).",

        "108":"As a general matter, this commenter suggested an alternative approach whereby the creditor would provide a disclosure\u2014in bold face or larger font and set off from other disclosures\u2014urging the consumer to be aware that the loan originator's compensation may increase or decrease based on the profitability of the creditor and urging the consumer to shop for credit to ensure that he or she has obtained the most favorable loan terms.",
        "109":"The community bank commenter also argued that, to attract quality loan originators without having the ability to pay incentive compensation, the bank would have to pay such a high salary that it could risk creating a disincentive for the individual loan originator to produce high volume.",

        "103":"As the Bureau explained in the proposal, salary and commission amounts are more likely than bonuses to be set in advance. Salaries are typically paid out of budgeted operating expenses rather than a \u201cprofit pool\u201d; commissions typically are paid for individual transactions and without reference to the person's profitability; and the salary and commission amounts often are stipulated by an employment or commission agreement.",

CFPB Bulletin 2012-2 stated that, until this final rule was adopted, employers could make contributions to certain \u201cQualified Plans\u201d (defined in CFPB Bulletin 2012-2 to include \u201cqualified profit sharing, 401(k), and employee stock ownership plans\u201d) for individual loan originator employees even if the contributions were derived from profits generated by mortgage loan originations. It explicitly did not address how the rules applied to \u201cprofit-sharing arrangements/plans that are not in the nature of Qualified Plans,\u201d which the Bureau wrote would be addressed in this rulemaking. Until the final rule goes into effect, the clarifications in CFPB Bulletin 2012-2 will remain in effect.",
        "101":"The Bureau discussed how, for example, the incentive of individual loan originators to upcharge likely diminishes as the total number of individual loan originators contributing to the profit pool increases. The incentives may be mitigated because: (1) Each individual loan originator's efforts will have increasingly less impact on compensation paid under profit-sharing plans; and (2) the ability of an individual loan originator to coordinate efforts with the other individual loan originators will decrease. The Bureau cited a number of economic studies regarding this \u201cfree-riding\u201d behavior. The Bureau also stated that this may be particularly true at large institutions with many individual loan originators because the nexus among the terms of the transactions of the multiple individual loan originators, the revenues of the organization, the profits of the organization, and the compensation decisions may be more diffuse in a large organization.",
        "106":"The association specifically cited 12 CFR 701.21(c)(8)(iii), which permits credit unions to pay bonuses or incentives to credit union employees either based on the credit union's overall financial performance or in connection with a loan or loans, provided that the credit union board of directors establishes written policies and internal controls for such incentives or bonuses.",
        "107":"This commenter also questioned the interplay of the proposal with the 2012 HOEPA Proposal insofar as the 2012 HOEPA Proposal would have redefined points and fees to include certain compensation paid to individual loan originators. As noted earlier in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.36(a), however, the definition of points and fees across the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule and the 2013 ATR Final Rule includes only compensation that can be attributed to a particular transaction at the time the interest rate is set.",
        "104":"This commenter based this assertion on several points, including that participation by multiple employees dilutes the impact and reward for any one participant, the delayed nature of a bonus pool payout erodes the incentive to steer for quick gains, bonus pools merely supplement and augment an employee's compensation, and most bonus plans\u2014especially for community bank loan originators\u2014contain a variety of components other than mortgage revenue.",
        "105":"Several commenters echoed this argument that the types of practices the Bureau is regulating are better suited for examination and enforcement. One State trade association wrote that if bonuses are improperly designed to reward specific individual loan originators for transaction terms, this fact will be ascertainable through examination. A national trade association representing the mortgage industry suggested the Bureau use its authority under the Dodd-Frank Act to prevent unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. A State credit union trade association suggested the Bureau enforce existing regulations before imposing new regulations. One commenter claimed that the Bureau overreached in its proposal and needed to provide evidence that a profit motive in a transparent cost environment could be an example of an unfair or deceptive practice in order to support the approach it followed in the proposal.",

That new section provides an exemption for creditors operating in rural, but not underserved, areas. Consequently, the single, combined list of all counties that are either rural or underserved that the Bureau will publish annually for purposes of the exemption from this final rule's escrow requirement is inadequate for the analogous purpose under the new appraisal requirements in \u00a7 1026.35(c).",

The Bureau recognizes that, even with comment 36(d)(1)-5 in place, a creditor and individual loan originator still could engage in a similar business model involving non-competitive overall credit pricing to support inflated loan originator compensation\u2014but they would have to be content to limit their business exclusively to less sophisticated consumers such as consumer Y because their inability to reduce their compensation to bear the cost of selective pricing concessions would mean foregoing more sophisticated consumers' business. The Bureau is skeptical that the regulatory limitations and market pressures would permit such a model to work on a large scale, if at all. Moreover, the 2013 ATR Final Rule and the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule include loan originator compensation in points and fees for the thresholds for both qualified mortgages and high-cost mortgages, so these points and fees limits impose additional constraints on the ability of creditors and loan originators to inflate loan originator compensation.",

Section 1024.7(e)(3) provides that all other estimated charges may change by any amount prior to settlement (no tolerance).
