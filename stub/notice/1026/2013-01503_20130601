                "Section 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act added TILA section 129C(e)(1), which prohibits a closed-end consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling or an extension of open-end consumer credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling from containing terms that require arbitration or any other non-judicial procedure as the method for resolving disputes arising out of the transaction. TILA section 129C(e)(2) provides that, subject to TILA section 129C(e)(3) a consumer and creditor or any assignee may nonetheless agree, after a dispute arises, to use arbitration or other non-judicial procedure to resolve the dispute. The statute further provides in section 129C(e)(3) that no covered transaction secured by a dwelling, and no related agreement between the consumer and creditor, may be applied or interpreted to bar a consumer from bringing a claim in court in connection with any alleged violation of Federal law.",
                "The Bureau proposed \u00a7 1026.36(h) to implement these statutory provisions, pursuant to TILA section 105(a) and section 1022(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Proposed \u00a7 1026.36(h)(2) would have clarified the interaction between TILA sections 129C(e)(2) and (e)(3), and the section-by-section analysis noted that TILA section 129C(e)(3) and \u00a7 1026.36(h)(2) do not address State law causes of action.",
                "Commenters generally supported the proposal. Although some commenters addressed details of the substance of the proposal, many commenters addressed the timing of the provisions' implementation. For example, several consumer groups stated that the proposal did not make any substantive changes to the statutory provisions and should be withdrawn because there was no reason to delay the effective date of the statutory provisions. One commenter acknowledged that the provisions were mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act but urged the Bureau to encourage mandatory arbitration anyway. SBA Advocacy stated that some Small Entity Representatives did not understand why the provisions were being included in this rule and asked the Bureau to consider adopting it at a later date. A bank association commenter urged the Bureau to delay the provisions until after it completed its required general study of arbitration clauses in consumer transactions, pursuant to section 1028 of the Dodd-Frank Act.",
                "One commenter requested clarification on whether the provisions apply to waivers of rights to a jury trial. Other commenters questioned variously whether the proposal altered the statutory provisions: By applying the provision on waivers of causes of action to post-dispute agreements; by applying that provision to loans other than residential mortgage loans and open-end consumer credit plans secured by a principal dwelling; by limiting it to Federal causes of action; or by prohibiting mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts and agreements other than the note and agreements related to the note. One commenter stated that the applicability of the proposed rule provisions was confusing because the provisions refer to consumer transactions secured by a dwelling but their scope is also addressed separately in proposed \u00a7 1026.36(j). (Proposed \u00a7 1026.36(j) is finalized as \u00a7 1026.36(b) of the rule.) Finally, one commenter suggested that the statute and the rule would prohibit nonjudicial foreclosures and prevent a servicer from settling a dispute with a consumer through a settlement agreement.",
                "The provisions on mandatory arbitration and waiver are contained in the Dodd-Frank Act. Absent action by the Bureau, they would take effect on January 21, 2013. The Bureau believes that it is necessary and appropriate to provide implementing language to facilitate compliance with the statute. At the same time, the Bureau recognizes the point made by several commenters regarding the importance of these consumer protections. The fact that the Bureau is implementing the provisions by regulation does not require the Bureau to delay the provisions' effective date for an extended period, as the commenters may have assumed. Instead, the Bureau is providing an effective date of June 1, 2013. The Bureau believes this effective date will give consumers the benefit of these statutory protections within a short timeframe, while also providing industry time to adjust its systems and practices. The Bureau does not believe that industry needs a longer period because the prohibitions on mandatory arbitration agreements and waivers of Federal claims have been known since the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, and this final rule will not require extensive changes to origination systems. Furthermore, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do not accept loans that require arbitration or other nonjudicial procedures to resolve disputes, so the Bureau believes this aspect of the statute and final rule will not necessitate significant changes to current practices in most circumstances. The Bureau is not providing that the provision become effective immediately, however, in order to provide industry a short period to make any needed adjustments.",
                "In response to the comments, the Bureau does not interpret TILA section 129C(e)(3) to limit waivers of rights to a jury trial because bench trials are judicial procedures, not nonjudicial procedures. The Bureau does not interpret TILA section 129C(e)(1) to limit deeds of trust providing for nonjudicial foreclosure because such instruments are not agreements to use nonjudicial procedures to resolve controversies or settle claims arising out of the transaction, in contrast with agreements to use arbitration, mediation, and other forms of alternative dispute resolution. Nor does the Bureau interpret TILA section 129C(e)(3) to limit nonjudicial foreclosures because nonjudicial foreclosures still allow consumers to bring actions in court alleging violations of Federal law.",
                "Similarly, the Bureau does not interpret the statute to bar settlement agreements. Such a result would be a highly unusual\u2014perhaps unprecedented\u2014prohibition, and the Bureau believes that Congress would have spoken expressly about settlement agreements if that was the result it intended.\n      Instead, the Bureau reads the statute to mean that if a consumer and creditor or assignee agree, after a dispute or claim arises, to settle the dispute or claim, the settlement agreement may be applied or interpreted to waive the consumer's right to bring that dispute or claim in court, even if it is a Federal law claim. Accordingly, the Bureau is revising the regulatory text to clarify that \u00a7 1026.36(h) does not limit a consumer and creditor or any assignee from agreeing, after a dispute or claim under the transaction arises, to settle that dispute or claim. Under TILA section 129C(e)(3) and \u00a7 1026.36(h)(2), however, no settlement agreement may be applied or interpreted to bar the consumer from bringing an action in court for any other alleged violation of Federal law.",
                "The Bureau is further revising the regulatory text to address the belief of some commenters that the Bureau had altered the scope of the statutory provision. As discussed above, TILA section 129C(e)(2) provides that the exception for post-dispute agreements from the prohibition on mandatory arbitration agreements is itself subject to the prohibition on waivers of rights to bring Federal causes of action in court. The proposal specified that a post-dispute agreement to use arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure could not limit the ability of the consumer to bring a covered claim through the agreed-upon procedure. This final rule clarifies that, consistent with the discussion of waivers of causes of action in settlement agreements above, the Bureau interprets the statute to mean that if a consumer and creditor or assignee agree, after a dispute or claim arises, to use arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure to resolve that dispute or claim, the agreement may be applied or interpreted to waive the consumer's right to bring that dispute or claim in court, even if it is a Federal law claim. The Bureau believes that, in such an instance, the consumer is aware of the specific dispute or claim at issue and is therefore in a better position to make a knowing decision whether to resolve the dispute or claim without bringing an action in court. But no post-dispute agreement to use arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure may be applied or interpreted to bar the consumer from bringing an action in court for any other alleged violation of Federal law.",
                "The Bureau disagrees with commenters who stated it had expanded the scope of TILA section 129C(e) to cover open-end consumer credit plans other than those secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer. Proposed \u00a7 1026.36(j) (implemented in this final rule as \u00a7 1026.36(b)) clarifies the scope of each of the other substantive paragraphs in \u00a7 1026.36 and provides that the only open-end consumer credit plans to which \u00a7 1026.36(h) applies are those secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer. However, to reduce uncertainty, the Bureau is including a statement in \u00a7 1026.36(h) that it is applicable to \u201ca home equity line of credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling.\u201d",
                "The Bureau also disagrees that the proposed language changed the scope of the prohibition on waivers of causes of action by including the word \u201cFederal\u201d in the paragraph (h)(2) heading, \u201cNo waivers of Federal statutory causes of action.\u201d The contents of paragraph (h)(2) and the corresponding statutory paragraph (e)(3) both provide that the prohibition applies to alleged violations of Section 129C of TILA, any other provision of TILA, or any other Federal law. Thus, the scope of the statutory prohibition is limited to Federal law, and the implementing regulation is properly so limited.",
                "Finally, the Bureau disagrees that the prohibition on agreements to use mandatory arbitration applies only to the note itself. TILA section 129C(e)(1) provides that it applies to the terms of a residential mortgage loan and to an extension of credit under an open-end consumer credit plan secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer. The terms of such transactions are frequently memorialized in multiple documents. Plainly, the prohibition cannot be evaded simply by including a provision for mandatory arbitration in a document other than the note if that document is executed as part of the transaction. The prohibition applies to the terms of the whole transaction, regardless of which particular document contains those terms. However, to prevent any misunderstanding that the prohibition applies to agreements that are not part of the credit transaction, the Bureau is replacing the phrase \u201ccontract or agreement in connection with a\u201d consumer credit transaction with the phrase \u201ccontract or other agreement for\u201d a consumer credit transaction."
