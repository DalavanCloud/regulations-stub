    "abstract": "The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) issues this final rule to implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act's amendments to the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. The final rule amends Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) by expanding the types of mortgage loans that are subject to the protections of the Home Ownership and Equity Protections Act of 1994 (HOEPA), revising and expanding the tests for coverage under HOEPA, and imposing additional restrictions on mortgages that are covered by HOEPA, including a pre-loan counseling requirement. The final rule also amends Regulation Z and Regulation X (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act) by imposing certain other requirements related to homeownership counseling, including a requirement that consumers receive information about homeownership counseling providers.",

Creditors opening open-end credit plans must compare the annual percentage rate for the plan to the average prime offer rate for the most closely comparable closed-end transaction. To identify the most closely comparable closed-end transaction, the creditor should identify whether the credit plan is fixed- or variable-rate; if the plan is fixed-rate, the term of the plan to maturity; if the plan is variable-rate, the duration of any initial, fixed-rate period; and the date the interest rate for the plan is set. If a fixed-rate plan has no definite plan length, a creditor must use the average prime offer rate for a 30-year fixed-rate loan. If a variable-rate plan has an optional, fixed-rate feature, a creditor must use the rate table for variable-rate transactions. If a variable-rate plan has an initial, fixed-rate period that is not in whole years, a creditor must identify the most closely-comparable transaction by using the number of whole years closest to the actual fixed-rate period. For example, if a variable-rate plan has an initial fixed-rate period of 20 months, a creditor must use the average prime offer rate for a two-year adjustable-rate loan. If a variable-rate plan has no initial fixed-rate period, or if it has an initial fixed-rate period of less than one year, a creditor must use the average prime offer rate for a one-year adjustable-rate loan. Thus, for example, if the initial fixed-rate period is six months, a creditor must use the average prime offer rate for a one-year adjustable-rate loan.",

Thus, in determining the \u201ctotal loan amount\u201d for purposes of applying the triggers under \u00a7 1026.32, the amount of credit that would have been extended if the loan had been documented as a closed-end loan is a factual determination to be made in each case. Factors to be considered include the amount of money the consumer originally requested, the amount of the first advance or the highest outstanding balance, or the amount of the credit line. The full amount of the credit line is considered only to the extent that it is reasonable to expect that the consumer might use the full amount of credit.",

        "234": "The HMDA data contain a flag which indicates whether a loan was classified as a high-cost mortgage as well as a variable that reports the spread between the loan's APR and the APOR for higher-priced mortgage loans. Higher-priced mortgage loans are first-liens for which this spread is at least 1.5 percentage points and subordinate liens with a spread of 3.5 percentage points or greater. Importantly, the \u201chigher-priced\u201d mortgage loan thresholds are well below the APR thresholds for HOEPA. The spread is calculated as of the date the loan's rate was set. Based on these variables, the analysis defines as a high-cost mortgage any HMDA loan that is either flagged as a high-cost mortgage or that has an estimated APR spread that exceeds the relevant HOEPA threshold. The current HOEPA APR threshold is relative to a comparable Treasury security, but the reported spread in HMDA is relative to APOR, so it is not possible to determine with certainty whether a HMDA loan meets the current APR threshold, and not all loans that are estimated to be above the APR threshold are flagged as high-cost mortgages. The Bureau also considered a narrower definition of a high-cost mortgage, namely, any loan that was identified as a high-cost mortgage in the HMDA data. Conclusions based on this alternative definition are qualitatively similar to those under the primary, more conservative definition described above.", 
        "235": "The statistical model captures the effect of the changes in the APR thresholds through the fact that the gap between the thresholds and APR would generally narrow, which increases the estimated probability that a loan would have been flagged as a high-cost mortgage. Modeling the probability as a function of loan size indirectly approximates the effect of the Dodd-Frank Act revisions to the points-and-fees thresholds. More specifically, the points-and-fees threshold is defined, in part, based on points and fees as a percentage of the loan amount, so that, given two loans with identical points and fees, the loan with a smaller loan amount should be more likely to be flagged as a high-cost mortgage. Indeed, high-cost mortgages are more prevalent for loans with smaller loan amounts in HMDA. Thus, this appears to provide a reasonable approach to capturing variation in the likelihood that a loan is a high-cost mortgage. The Bureau solicited public comment seeking information or data (including data on points and fees or on prepayment penalties) from interested parties that could be used to refine or evaluate this approximation, but the Bureau did not receive any such information or data.", 
        "236": "Loans potentially subject to HOEPA coverage in this context are loans for non-business purposes secured by a lien on an owner-occupied 1-4 family property, including manufactured homes. In addition, the estimate of the share of loans subject to HOEPA coverage currently excludes purchase money mortgages, which are included in the estimate of this share under the final rule. The estimated share of loans currently classified as high-cost mortgages is about 0.06 percent if purchase-money mortgages are included in the set of loans considered.", 
        "237": "The estimates of the share of loans that would be classified as high-cost mortgages if the revised thresholds had been in place are, more precisely, estimates of the number of loans potentially classified as high-cost mortgages and do not account for lenders' decision to originate or not originate a loan based on high-cost mortgage status. If some lenders avoid making high-cost mortgages, this estimate would be an upper bound on the number of high-cost mortgages that might be originated under the revised thresholds. The estimated number of high-cost mortgages in the absence of lenders' responses is the relevant estimate for gauging the maximum loss in revenue that could occur for a lender that chose to make no high-cost mortgages under the revised thresholds.", 
        "238": "The share of small DIs estimated to make any high-cost mortgages under the revised HOEPA thresholds is substantially higher in this analysis than in the analysis conducted at the proposal stage. This primarily reflects a difference in how the results are reported. The previous analysis only counted lenders that were estimated to make at least one high-cost mortgage under the revised thresholds as making a high-cost mortgage. This analysis counts lenders that are estimated to have a small, but non-zero, probability of making a high-cost mortgage, weighted by that probability. Note that this does not increase the share of small DIs estimated to make 10 or more high-cost mortgages. These and other estimates in this analysis can of course differ from estimates presented in the proposal due to, for example, refinements in the estimation methodology and the incorporation of updated data.",

On the other hand, the Bureau believes that points and fees may be less prevalent for HELOCs than for closed-end mortgages.", 
        "242": "This calculation is based on estimating the potential revenue loss on HELOCs for each depository based on information in the Call Report data. This estimate is combined with an estimate of losses on closed-end mortgages for HMDA reporters.

In contrast, the estimated ongoing costs of providing the disclosure in the final rule are based on the assumption that the disclosure is prepared by a loan processor. Accordingly, the estimated one-time training costs associated with this information collection reflects training costs for not only loan officers (as in the proposed rule) but also loan processors.

                                "As noted above, new RESPA section 5(c) requires lenders to include a list of homeownership counselors located in the area of the lender with the home buying information booklet that is to be distributed to applicants. To implement RESPA section 5(c), the Bureau proposed in \u00a7 1024.20(a)(1) that the list of homeownership counselors or counseling agencies be provided to applicants for all federally related mortgage loans, except for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1024.20(c) below. Under RESPA and its implementing regulations, a federally related mortgage loan includes purchase-money mortgage loans, subordinate-lien mortgages, refinancings, closed-end home-equity mortgage loans, HELOCs, and reverse mortgages.\n             Thus, proposed \u00a7 1024.20(a)(1) would have required that lenders provide the list of homeownership counselors to applicants for numerous types of federally related mortgage loans beyond purchase-money mortgages.", 
                                "As the Bureau noted in the preamble of the proposal, based on its reading of section 5 of RESPA as amended, and its understanding of the purposes of that section, the Bureau believes that the amendments to RESPA indicate that Congress intended the booklet and list of counselors to be provided to applicants for all federally related mortgage loans and not just purchase-money mortgage loans. The Bureau acknowledged that section 5(d) of RESPA, in language that was not amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, requires lenders to provide the home buying information booklet \u201cto each person from whom [the lender] receives or for whom it prepares a written application to borrow money to finance the purchase of residential real estate.\u201d However, the Bureau also noted that RESPA sections 5(a) and (b), as amended, indicate that the booklet and list of counselors are to be provided to applicants for all federally related mortgage loans. Section 5(a) as amended (1) specifically references helping consumers applying for federally related mortgage loans understand the nature and costs of real estate settlement services; and (2) directs the Bureau to distribute the booklet and the lists of housing counselors to lenders that make federally related mortgage loans. Moreover, the prescribed content of the booklet is not limited to information on purchase-money mortgages. Under RESPA section 5(b), as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, the booklet must include information specific to refinancings and HELOCs, as well as \u201cthe costs incident to a real estate settlement or a federally related mortgage loan.\u201d", 
                                "Additionally, the Bureau noted in the preamble of the proposal its view that a trained counselor can be useful to any consumer considering any type of mortgage loan. Mortgage transactions beyond purchase-money transactions, such as refinancings and open-end home-secured credit transactions, can entail significant risks and costs for consumers\u2014risks and costs that a trained homeownership counselor can assist consumers in fully understanding.", 
                                "Thus, for the reasons noted above, the Bureau proposed in \u00a7 1024.20(a)(1) to interpret the scope of the homeownership counselor list requirement to apply to all federally related mortgage loans pursuant to section 19(a) of RESPA, which provides the Bureau with the authority to \u201cprescribe such rules and regulations, to make such interpretations, and to grant such reasonable exemptions for classes of transactions, as may be necessary to achieve the purposes of the [RESPA].\u201d", 
                                "The Bureau sought comment from the public on the costs and benefits of the provision of the list of homeownership counselors to applicants for refinancings and HELOCs. The Bureau also sought comment on the potential effect of the Bureau's proposal on access to homeownership counseling generally by consumers, and the effect of increased consumer demand on existing counseling resources. In particular, the Bureau solicited comment on the effect on counseling resources of providing the list beyond applicants for purchase-money mortgages.", 
                                "A number of industry commenters stated that lenders should not be required to provide counselor lists to applicants for refinancings or HELOCs. One large bank commenter, for example, asserted that the congressional intent to limit the requirement to purchase- money mortgages is clear. Some other commenters were concerned that applicants for refinancings or HELOCs would either ignore the list or be offended by the suggestion that they would benefit from counseling, because such applicants already understand how mortgages work. Comments from consumer groups and a State Attorney General's office, however, supported the requirement to provide the counselor list to applicants for refinancings and HELOCs. Such commenters noted, for example, that consumers may find themselves in financial distress only after tapping into their home equity through a refinancing or a HELOC, in some cases repeatedly.", 
                                "The Bureau is generally finalizing in \u00a7 1024.20(a)(1) the requirement to provide a list of counseling providers to applicants of federally related mortgage loans as proposed, for the reasons noted above. The Bureau continues to believe that the statutory language as a whole indicates Congress's intent to require lenders to provide the counselor list to applicants of refinancings and HELOCs, as well as purchase-money mortgages. Moreover, the Bureau agrees with commenters that suggest applicants for refinancings or HELOCs may benefit from information about counseling, even though such applicants have previously obtained a mortgage. The Bureau is, however, also adopting certain exemptions from the requirement, as described in the discussion of \u00a7 1024.20(c) below."

                                "As discussed above, RESPA section 5(c) requires that the list of homeownership counselors be comprised of homeownership counselors certified pursuant to section 106(e) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 and located in the area of the lender. RESPA section 5(c) does not specify any particular information about homeownership counselors that must be provided on the required list. Proposed \u00a7 1024.20(a)(1) would have provided that the list include five homeownership counselors or homeownership counseling organizations located in the zip code of the applicant's current address or, if there were not the requisite five counselors or counseling organizations in that zip code, counselors or organizations within the zip code or zip codes closest to the loan applicant's current address. Proposed \u00a7 1024.20(a)(2) would have required lenders to include in the list only homeownership counselors or counseling organizations from either the most current list of homeownership counselors or counseling organizations made available by the Bureau for use by lenders in complying with \u00a7 1024.20, or the most current list maintained by HUD of homeownership counselors or counseling organizations certified or otherwise approved by HUD. Proposed \u00a7 1024.20(a)(3) would have required that the list include: (1) Each counselor's or counseling organization's name, business address, telephone number and, if available from the Bureau or HUD, other contact information; and (2) contact information for the Bureau and HUD.", 
                                "The Bureau stated in the preamble of the proposal that it expected to develop a Web site portal to facilitate compliance with the counselor list requirement. As the Bureau explained, such a Web site portal would allow lenders to type in the loan applicant's zip code to generate the requisite list, which could then be printed for distribution to the loan applicant. The Bureau also stated its belief that such an approach: (1) Could significantly mitigate any paperwork burden associated with requiring that the list be distributed to applicants for federally related mortgage loans; and (2) is consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act's amendment to section 5(a) of RESPA requiring the Bureau to distribute to lenders \u201clists, organized by location, of homeownership counselors certified under section 106(e) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701x(e)) for use in complying with the requirement under [section 5(c)].\u201d",

The Bureau also solicited comment on whether its planned Web site portal would be useful and whether there are other mechanisms through which the Bureau can help facilitate compliance and provide lists to lenders and consumers.", 
                                "A significant number of industry commenters objected to the proposed requirement to create individualized lists for borrowers as overly burdensome. Some commenters raised concerns that having to create these individualized lists would expose them to risk in the event of an error in compiling the list. Many industry commenters suggested that lenders should instead be permitted to comply with the requirement by providing Bureau and HUD contact information for the consumer to obtain information about counselors. Other commenters suggested it would be more beneficial to refer consumers to web databases containing all counselors in a state, or to provide a list based on an applicant's state rather than zip code. Commenters argued that changing the provision to allow compliance through a static list would minimize costs, create greater efficiency, and be more accurate. Some commenters argued that locating the nearest zip code to a consumer's home zip code would be overly burdensome. Several commenters objected to the requirement that the list be obtained from \u201cthe most current\u201d lists of counselors or counseling organizations maintained by the Bureau or HUD, or suggested that \u201cmost current\u201d should mean \u201cmonthly.\u201d A number of consumer group commenters, however, supported the requirement for an individualized list because such a list would be most beneficial to consumers. One such commenter also noted that requiring lenders to retrieve a fresh list for each applicant will ensure the lists received by consumers are the most up-to-date.", 
                                "Industry commenters were generally very supportive of the Bureau's intention to create a Web site portal to facilitate compliance, particularly if the individualized list requirement were retained. Some industry commenters noted that the list requirement would not be difficult to comply with as proposed, if a Web site portal were available. A few commenters, while primarily supportive of a requirement to provide a static rather than an individualized list, alternatively favored the idea of the Web site portal to generate the list (including automatically selecting adjacent zip codes to an applicant's zip code, if necessary). Some commenters requested a safe harbor for lenders providing a list generated through the Web site portal. Commenters proposed a number of additions or variations to the Web site portal. A number of industry commenters stated the Bureau should provide lenders with the option to import the data from the Web site portal directly into their systems, to ease compliance burden. Several industry commenters noted it would be essential that the Web site portal generate a list for lenders based on a simple zip code query. A few commenters suggested that the Web site portal should provide a randomized list in response to a zip code query, to avoid favoritism. Some commenters suggested the Web site portal should be made available to the public and publicized by the Bureau (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> though a public campaign in coordination with homeownership counseling organizations, counseling trade groups, and HUD), and that lenders should be required to make lists available through their Web sites, branch offices, and mortgage advertising. Several commenters stated that the Bureau should coordinate the development of its Web site portal with HUD, so lenders are not required to search two separate databases.", 
                                "A number of industry commenters raised concerns about the requirement to provide a list of five counselors or counseling agencies, asserting that five is an arbitrary number and that it would be a difficult requirement to meet in certain geographic locations. Some commenters noted, for example, that Alaska has only three counseling agencies statewide, and that Wyoming has only four. One commenter suggested that lenders should not have to disclose counselors from different states, if there are not five counselors in the consumer's state. A few commenters suggested that the requirement be more flexible and require, for example, a list of \u201cno fewer than three\u201d counseling agencies.", 
                                "Several consumer advocacy and housing counselor advocacy groups commented that only homeownership counseling agencies, rather than individual homeownership counselors, should be permitted to appear on the list. These commenters noted that providing a list of individual counselors to consumers is neither practical nor efficient, as an individual counselor may not be available. A few commenters suggested that the list include agencies offering remote counseling services. For example, an alliance of counseling organizations suggested the list be required to include a minimum number of national counseling agencies or intermediaries\n             outside of a consumer's zip code that can provide phone counseling.", 
                                "Several consumer advocacy and housing counselor advocacy commenters requested that additional information be required to be provided on the list. For example, they asked that the lists be required to include a counseling agency's specialty (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> pre-purchase, refinance, home equity, rental, reverse mortgage, etc.) and any foreign language capacity. Another commenter requested that the list include a description of the services that the counselor would provide and fees typically charged for such services.", 
                                "Based on the comments received concerning compliance burden and the potential operational difficulties associated with developing lists as envisioned in the proposal, the Bureau is revising \u00a7 1024.20(a)(1) to require lenders to fulfill the list obligation through use of either a Bureau Web site or data made available by the Bureau or HUD. Specifically, final \u00a7 1024.20(a)(1) allows lenders to distribute lists of counseling organizations providing relevant counseling services in the applicant's location that are obtained up to 30 days in advance from either a Web site maintained by the Bureau or data made available by the Bureau or HUD for lenders to use in complying with the requirements of \u00a7 1024.20, provided that the data are used in accordance with instructions provided with the data. Because lenders will thus generate the required lists through either a Web site that will automatically provide the required content of the list based on certain inputs, or through data that is accompanied by instructions to generate lists consistent with the Web site, the final rule also eliminates proposed \u00a7 1024.20(a)(1)(i) and (ii) and proposed \u00a7 1024.20(a)(2) and (3) as unnecessary.", 
                                "The Bureau intends to create a Web site portal, in close coordination with HUD, that will require lenders to input certain required information (such as, for example, the applicant's zip code and the type of mortgage product) in order to generate a list of homeownership counseling organizations that provide relevant counseling services in the loan applicant's location. While the Bureau understands the concerns raised by commenters about the burden of generating zip-code based lists for potential borrowers, the Bureau notes that the statutory requirement indicates that the list should be comprised of counselors \u201clocated in the area of the lender.\u201d The Bureau is interpreting this requirement to mean the location of the applicant who is being served by the lender. The Bureau continues to believe that a list of counseling resources available near the applicant's location will be most useful to the applicant.\n             The Bureau also believes that permitting lists to be generated based on larger geographic areas, such as an applicant's state, would frequently result in an applicant receiving a list that is overwhelmingly lengthy. The Bureau notes, for example, that HUD's Web site indicates that there are a significant number of states that are served by well over 20 homeownership counseling organizations. The Bureau notes, moreover, that the Web site portal will obviate the need for a lender to determine the closest zip codes to an applicant.", 
                                "The Bureau recognizes the concerns of industry commenters that requiring greater data inputs from lenders to generate a list will increase the burden on the lender. The Bureau intends to require as few data inputs as practicable to generate a relevant list for the applicant, in order to minimize compliance burden. The Bureau agrees with commenters that the Web site portal it develops should be made directly available to consumers, and the Bureau does intend to publicize the Web site portal to make consumers better aware of the counseling resources available.", 
                                "The Bureau also agrees with commenters who suggested the list should include only homeownership counseling organizations rather than individual counselors. The Bureau explained in the preamble of the proposal that it was proposing to allow the list to include counselors or counseling organizations certified or otherwise approved by HUD, pursuant to its exemption authority under section 19(a) of RESPA and its modification authority under section 1405(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau is finalizing \u00a7 1024.20(a)(1) to require that the list contain only counseling organizations, pursuant to the same exemption authority, and anticipates that the Web site portal it develops may generate lists that include counseling organizations that are either certified or otherwise approved by HUD.\n             Because the Web site portal will automatically create lists that include the relevant homeownership counseling organizations, the Bureau is not finalizing proposed \u00a7 1024.20(a)(2).", 
                                "The Bureau believes that allowing lenders to obtain the list up to 30 days prior to providing it to the loan applicant strikes an appropriate balance between ensuring the information received by consumers is useful, and avoiding unnecessary burdens on lenders. The Bureau notes a lender may be able to keep counselor lists generated based on certain data inputs on file, and provide those stored lists to applicants as appropriate for up to 30 days, in order to avoid generating a new list for each applicant.", 
                                "With respect to the information that will appear on the lists of counseling organizations, the Bureau notes that rather than specify particular information, such as the counseling organization's telephone number, that must appear on the list through regulation, the Bureau will design its Web site portal so that the appropriate information will automatically appear on the lists that are generated. The Bureau will also work to ensure that any data provided for compliance with the requirement is accompanied by instructions that will result in the creation of a list that is consistent with what would have been generated if the Web site portal had been used. Accordingly, the Bureau is not finalizing proposed \u00a7 1024.20(a)(3). The Bureau believes this will help ease compliance burden. The Bureau anticipates that the lists generated through its Web site portal or in accordance with its instructions will include contact information for the counseling organizations and may include additional information about the counseling organizations such as language capacity and areas of expertise. The Bureau also anticipates that the lists generated through its Web site portal will also include information enabling the consumer to access either the Bureau or the HUD list of homeownership counseling organizations, so that an applicant who receives the list can obtain information about additional counseling organizations if desired."

The definition of \u201capplication\u201d that would have applied appears in \u00a7 1024.2(b). The Bureau noted in the proposal that its 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal proposed to adopt a new definition of \u201capplication\u201d under Regulation Z, and it sought comment on whether to tie the provision of the list to this proposed definition instead of the definition in \u00a7 1024.2(b). Some industry commenters asked for greater flexibility with respect to the timing of the list requirement, so that a list could be provided later than three business days after the lender receives a loan application. A few consumer groups and a counseling association commenter objected to the timing of the list requirement on the basis that counseling should occur earlier in the shopping process, not at application. The Bureau received one comment in support of linking the timing requirement for the list with the good faith estimate required by RESPA. A few commenters noted that regardless of whether the list had to be provided at the same time as the RESPA good faith estimate, it should only have to be provided once per loan, even if a loan estimate had to be revised.",

The Bureau notes, however, that the statutory requirement provides that the list of homeownership counselors be provided with the home buying booklet. The Bureau agrees with commenters that stated a lender should only be required to provide a single list in conjunction with an application, and notes that the final rule does not require that more than one list be provided. In addition, because the Bureau has not yet finalized the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal, the Bureau declines to provide a different definition of application in the final rule.

                        "RESPA section 5(c) requires lenders to include a list of homeownership counselors with the home buying information booklet that is to be distributed to applicants. As noted above, the Bureau generally proposed in \u00a7 1024.20(a)(1) to interpret the scope of the homeownership counselor list requirement to apply to applicants of all federally related mortgage loans pursuant to section 19(a) of RESPA. Proposed \u00a7 1024.20(c) would have exempted a lender from providing an applicant for a HECM, as that type of reverse mortgage is defined in 12 U.S.C. 1715z-20(b)(3), with the list required by \u00a7 1024.20 if the lender is otherwise required by HUD to provide a list, and does provide a list, of HECM counselors or counseling agencies to the loan applicant. As discussed further below in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z, \u00a7 1026.34(a)(5), the Bureau's final pre-loan counseling requirement for high-cost mortgages, Federal law currently requires homeowners to receive counseling before obtaining a HECM reverse mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA),\n             which is a part of HUD. HUD imposes various requirements related to HECM counseling, including requiring FHA-approved HECM mortgagees to provide HECM applicants with a list of HUD-approved HECM counseling agencies. The Bureau noted in the preamble of the proposal its concern that a duplicative list requirement could cause confusion for consumers and unnecessary burden for lenders. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to exercise its exemption authority under RESPA section 19(a) to allow lenders that provide a list under HUD's HECM program to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1024.20.", 
                        "A trade association for the reverse mortgage industry argued that lenders should not be obligated to provide a counselor list to applicants for HECM mortgages through \u00a7 1024.20. This commenter stated that HECM lenders are already required to provide a lengthier list of counselors specializing in reverse mortgage counseling. The commenter pointed out that in most instances a HECM lender cannot even complete a HECM application until they receive a HECM counseling certificate, except in limited circumstances under which HECM applicants can waive counseling requirements (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> for some types of refinancings from a HECM to another HECM). The commenter also argued that lenders should not have to provide applicants for non-HECM reverse mortgages the counseling list if the lender meets the HECM counseling disclosure requirements.", 
                        "The Bureau agrees that lenders should not have to provide a list of counselors to HECM applicants because the list is of limited value for such applicants, given that the majority of such applicants would already have been required to receive counseling prior to submitting an application for a HECM. In addition, upon further consideration, the Bureau believes that lenders should not have to provide applicants for any reverse mortgages subject to Regulation Z \u00a7 1026.33(a) with a list of housing counselors. Given that counseling for HECMs and other reverse mortgages is typically provided by specially trained counselors, the Bureau believes that any additional counseling requirements related to these products would be better addressed separately. As noted above, HECM mortgagees are already required to provide HECM applicants with a list of HUD-approved HECM counseling agencies. The Bureau notes that it anticipates undertaking a rulemaking in the future to address how title XIV requirements apply to reverse mortgages and to consider other consumer protection issues in the reverse mortgage market.\n             That rulemaking will provide an opportunity to consider further issues related to counseling or counseling information on reverse mortgages. Because the Bureau concludes that requiring lenders to provide a list of counselors to reverse mortgage borrowers under \u00a7 1024.20 is largely duplicative of HECM requirements and may not provide additional, useful information for borrowers of other types of reverse mortgages, final \u00a7 1024.20(c)(1) provides an exemption for reverse mortgages pursuant to the Bureau's authority under RESPA section 19(a)."

The Bureau did not propose any type of exemption from the list requirement for this category of applicants. Timeshare industry commenters argued that the requirement for a list of counselors should not apply to lenders receiving an application for a mortgage secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare. They asserted an exception is warranted for mortgages secured by timeshares because of their belief that there was no Congressional intent to require counseling for timeshare buyers due to unique characteristics of the timeshare industry, the lack of predatory lending in this market, the lower risk to consumers associated with default of a mortgage secured by a timeshare,\n             the protections provided by State law, and the timeshare business model that relies upon purchase and financing documents being executed simultaneously.",

Although the Bureau believes that some form of counseling may be beneficial to such consumers, the Bureau is concerned that counselors at counseling agencies approved by HUD to counsel consumers on standard mortgage financing may not be trained to provide useful counseling addressing timeshare purchases. For that reason, the Bureau is concerned that the benefit of the list of counselors to a consumer purchasing a timeshare could be quite low. The Bureau has therefore determined that exempting timeshare purchases from the list requirement is reasonable, because it is unclear whether the list would provide helpful information to consumers. Accordingly, the final rule does not require a lender to provide an applicant for a mortgage loan secured by a timeshare, as described under 11 U.S.C. 101(53D), with the list of homeownership counseling organizations required under \u00a7 1024.20."

                        "Since the enactment of the original HOEPA legislation in 1994, TILA section 129(a) has set forth the information that creditors must provide in the additional disclosure for high-cost mortgages, and TILA section 129(b) has described the timing requirements for this disclosure. Specifically, under TILA section 129(b)(1), the disclosure must be provided not less than three business days prior to consummation of the transaction. Pursuant to TILA section 129(b)(2)(A), if the terms of the transaction change after the disclosures have been provided in a way that makes the disclosure inaccurate, then a new disclosure must be given. TILA section 129(b)(2)(B) provides that such new disclosures may be given by telephone if the consumer initiated the change and if, at consummation, the new disclosure is provided in writing and the consumer and creditor certify that the telephone disclosure was given at least three days before consummation. TILA section 129(b)(2)(C) permitted the Board (now the Bureau) to prescribe regulations authorizing the modification or waiver of rights under TILA section 129(b) if such modification was necessary to permit consumers to meet a bona fide financial emergency.", 
                        "TILA section 129(b) is implemented in existing \u00a7 1026.31(c)(1). Section 1026.31(c)(1) provides that the high-cost mortgage disclosure shall be provided at least three business days prior to consummation, and \u00a7 1026.31(c)(1)(i) sets forth the general rule for providing a new disclosure in the case of a change in terms. Section 1026.31(c)(1)(ii) permits the new disclosure for a change in terms to be provided by telephone in certain circumstances, and \u00a7 1026.31(c)(1)(iii) sets forth the conditions pursuant to which a consumer is permitted to modify or waive the three-day waiting period for a disclosure for a bona fide personal financial emergency.", 
                        "The Dodd-Frank Act did not amend TILA section 129(b)(2) concerning the timing requirements for high-cost mortgage disclosures, except to clarify that authority under TILA section 129(b)(2)(C) to permit a modification or waiver of rights for bona fide personal financial emergencies transferred from the Board to the Bureau. The Bureau thus proposed only limited revisions to \u00a7 1026.31(c)(1) and related commentary that would have reflected the expanded types of loans potentially subject to HOEPA coverage as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. For example, the proposal would have included the term \u201caccount opening\u201d in addition to \u201cconsummation\u201d to reflect the fact that the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the requirements for high-cost mortgages to HELOCs.", 
                        "The Bureau received one comment concerning proposed \u00a7 1026.31(c)(1). The commenter, a consumer advocacy organization, urged the Bureau to eliminate the language in \u00a7 1026.31(c)(1)(ii) permitting telephone disclosures when a consumer initiates a change in the transaction after the creditor has provided the high-cost mortgage disclosure, and that change results in different terms. The commenter argued that permitting telephone disclosures would encourage sloppiness and inconsistency in the delivery of information and argued that the consumer would not be able to remember the information conveyed. As noted above, \u00a7 1026.31(c)(1)(ii) permitting telephone disclosures in the case of a change in terms implements a long-existing provision of TILA. The Bureau would need to use its authority under TILA section 105(a) to remove this provision. Given that the Dodd-Frank Act neither removed nor revised this provision, the Bureau declines to make such a change at this time. With respect to the commenter's specific concerns, the Bureau notes that \u00a7 1026.31(c)(1)(ii) requires a written disclosure at consummation or account opening that reflects any changed terms, along with a certification by the consumer and creditor that telephone disclosures reflecting those terms were made at the appropriate time prior to consummation or account opening.", 
                        "The commenter similarly urged the Bureau to eliminate the language in \u00a7 1026.31(c)(1)(iii) permitting the consumer to modify the three-day waiting period for a bona fide personal financial emergency. The commenter stated that the urgency for financing for some consumers should not supplant protections for other consumers. The Bureau declines to remove or amend \u00a7 1026.31(c)(1)(iii). The Board prescribed \u00a7 1026.31(c)(1)(iii) pursuant to its authority under TILA section 129(b)(2)(C) when it first implemented HOEPA by final rule in 1995.\n\n             The Bureau understands that there may be concerns about creditors abusing the waiver provision in certain circumstances, however the Bureau believes that the provision may benefit consumers who, for example, are facing imminent foreclosure. Absent specific information indicating that a change is warranted, the Bureau declines to modify this long-standing provision. The Bureau thus finalizes its amendments to \u00a7 1026.31(c)(1) generally as proposed (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> to reflect the provision's expanded application to HELOCs), with only minor revisions for clarity.", 
                        "In addition, the Bureau is revising comment 31(c)(1)(i)-2 for clarification purposes and consistency with final \u00a7 1026.34(a)(10). Upon further consideration of these provisions, the Bureau recognizes that the prohibition of financing points and fees in \u00a7 1026.34(a)(10) prohibits the financing of any points and fees, as defined in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1) and (2), for all high-cost mortgages. This prohibition includes the financing of premiums or other charges for the optional products such as credit insurance described in proposed comment 31(c)(1)(i)-2. Section 1026.34(a)(10) permits, however, the financing of charges not included in the definition of points and fees. For example, \u00a7 1026.34(a)(10) permits the financing of bona fide third-party charges, such as fees charged by a third-party counselor in connection with the consumer's receipt of pre-loan counseling for a high-cost mortgage under \u00a7 1025.34(a)(5). Accordingly, proposed comment 31(c)(1)(i)-2 is revised for clarification purposes and consistency with these other provisions."

                        "Section 1433(f) of the Dodd-Frank Act added new section 129(v) to TILA, 15 U.S.C. 1639(v), which prescribes certain conditions under which a creditor or assignee of a high-cost mortgage that has failed to comply with a HOEPA requirement, despite acting in good faith, will not be deemed to have violated the requirement. Section 129(v) permits the creditor or assignee to use this provision when either of the two following sets of conditions is satisfied: (1) \u201cWithin 30 days of the loan closing and prior to the institution of any action, the consumer is notified of or discovers the violation, appropriate restitution is made, and whatever adjustments are necessary are made to the loan to either, at the choice of the consumer\u2014(A) make the loan satisfy the requirements of this chapter; or (B) in the case of a high-cost mortgage, change the terms of the loan in a manner beneficial to the consumer so that the loan will no longer be a high-cost mortgage\u201d; or (2) \u201cwithin 60 days of the creditor's discovery or receipt of notification of an unintentional violation or bona fide error and prior to the institution of any action, the consumer is notified of the compliance failure, appropriate restitution is made, and whatever adjustments are necessary are made to the loan to either, at the choice of the consumer\u2014(A) make the loan satisfy the requirements of this chapter; or (B) in the case of a high-cost mortgage, change the terms of the loan in a manner beneficial so that the loan will no longer be a high-cost mortgage.\u201d\n             The Bureau did not propose to issue regulatory guidance concerning this provision. The Bureau solicited comment on the extent to which creditors or assignees are likely to invoke this provision; whether regulatory guidance would be useful; and if so, what issues would be most important to address.", 
                        "The Bureau did not receive comments from industry suggesting that creditors or assignees would be likely to invoke the provision. However, the Bureau received a number of comments from industry and consumer groups that suggested the Bureau provide guidance on certain statutory terms. Both industry and consumer groups asked for a definition of the statutory term \u201cgood faith\u201d and also sought guidance on whether the statutory requirement that notice of an unintentional error be given \u201cprior to the institution of any action\u201d applies only to lawsuits initiated by the consumer, or should be construed more broadly to include enforcement actions and various types of informal disputes between the borrower and creditor. Consumer groups also sought guidance and clarification as to how a creditor's use of the statute to correct an unintentional violation will interplay with TILA rescission rights.\n            \n          ", 
                        "In addition, both industry and consumer groups sought guidance on the operation of the 30- and 60-day periods set forth in sections 129(v)(1) and (2), respectively. These commenters expressed concern that the statute, as drafted, could be interpreted to require a creditor or assignee seeking the benefit of section 129(v) to provide notice to the consumer, receive the election of the consumer's preferred adjustment, and implement the consumer's election within the 30- or 60-day period. Industry and consumer groups stated that such a timeframe would be unworkable, and industry commenters suggested this would result in creditors and assignees not using the provision.", 
                        "Both industry and consumer groups offered suggestions for a more workable operational framework. Specifically, industry commenters suggested that the 30- and 60-day time limits should refer only to the time in which the creditor or assignee must notify the consumer about the violation, but additional time should be afforded for the creditor to offer a choice of adjustments to the consumer, for the consumer to elect an adjustment, and the creditor to implement the consumer's elected adjustment. Consumer groups also noted that a consumer may need substantial time to consider a creditor's proposed adjustment in order to make an informed choice, and generally suggested that an additional 30 to 60 days from the time of notice be given to consumers to make an election of adjustment. Similarly, industry commenters suggested an additional time period of 30 to 60 days be afforded to the creditor or assignee to implement the consumer's elected adjustment and pay any restitution that may be appropriate.", 
                        "The Bureau recognizes that section 129(v) is a complex provision, and agrees with public commenters that several of the features and terms of the provision are ambiguous. However, it is not yet clear what role section 129(v) will play in HOEPA's scheme of regulation, particularly in light of the Dodd-Frank Act's comprehensive amendments to HOEPA, and the lack of comments from industry suggesting that creditors or assignees will be likely to invoke this provision. The Bureau therefore declines at this point to issue detailed interpretive guidance regarding section 129(v).", 
                        "However, the Bureau agrees with industry and consumer groups that it is important to clarify how the 30- and 60-day periods operate. Comments suggested that implementing the consumer's choice of adjustment\u2014which may require the creditor or assignee to make changes to the documentation, disclosure, or terms of a transaction\u2014may itself take more than 30 days. It is thus not feasible to require creditors and assignees invoking the provision to also provide notice of the violation to the consumer and allow the consumer appropriate time to consider and elect an adjustment and to provide notice of that election to the creditor within that same 30 or 60 day period.", 
                        "The Bureau is adopting a new provision at \u00a7 1026.31(h) and accompanying comment 31(h)-1 interpreting section 129(v) to address these issues. Section 1026.31(h) states that a creditor or assignee in a high-cost mortgage who, when acting in good faith, failed to comply with a requirement under section 129 of the Act will not be deemed to have violated such requirement if the creditor or assignee satisfies specified conditions. Those conditions include providing notice to the consumer within 30 or 60 days (as appropriate) of the prescribed triggering conditions and implementing the consumer's chosen adjustments and providing appropriate restitution within a reasonable time.", 
                        "In adopting new provision \u00a7 1026.31(h), the Bureau is interpreting the language of section 129(v) to provide greater clarity with respect to these timeframes, which will assist creditors, assignees, and consumers seeking to use section 129(v). In the Bureau's view, section 129(v) is ambiguous regarding whether the \u201cwithin 30 [or 60] days\u201d timing requirement encompasses all the events that must occur for a creditor or assignee to claim the provision's benefit\u2014including the implementation of the consumer's choice of adjustment\u2014or only the first step, the consumer's notification or discovery of the violation. The Bureau believes Congress's intent was to make it possible, under appropriate circumstances, for creditors and assignees to satisfy the conditions of section 129(v). If securing the protection of section 129(v) required a creditor or assignee to complete within 30 or 60 days tasks that cannot reasonably be done in that time, creditors or assignees might never seek to use the provision. The Bureau thus believes that, to effectuate Congress's intent, section 129(v) should be interpreted, if possible, so that creditors and assignees can feasibly meet its conditions. The Bureau agrees with industry and consumer groups that it would be unworkable for a creditor to complete within 30 or 60 days all the steps to qualify for section 129(v) relief. Accordingly, the Bureau interprets the language of section 129(v) to mean that the 30- and 60-day statutory periods set forth the timeframe for providing notice of the violation to the consumer, but does not also require that the consumer elect an adjustment and that the creditor or assignee implement that adjustment, along with appropriate restitution, within the same timeframe.", 
                        "With respect to the remaining statutory conditions\u2014the consumer's election of an adjustment, the creditor or assignee's implementation of that adjustment, and the creditor or assignee's paying of any appropriate restitution\u2014the Bureau believes that Congress intended this provision to encourage creditors and assignees who have acted in good faith to remediate their violations of HOEPA, and that additional time is necessary for them to do so.", 
                        "However, the Bureau stresses that, for a creditor or assignee to enjoy the benefit of section 129(v), the required adjustment must still be completed in a reasonable time. While the Bureau interprets the specified 30- or 60-day period to cover only notice of a violation to the consumer, the Bureau does not believe Congress intended to allow the remaining steps in section 129(v) to take an arbitrarily long time. The Bureau believes Congress intended a creditor or assignee to make the appropriate restitution and complete the required section 129(v) modification within a reasonable time period.\n\n             In the Bureau's view, allowing a reasonable time for a creditor or assignee to carry out the steps necessary to benefit from section 129(v) would effectuate Congress's purpose of encouraging creditors and assignees who have acted in good faith to remediate their violations of HOEPA. If a creditor could take any amount of time to fulfill the section 129(v) conditions, the creditor might wait without completing the required modification unless and until it faced liability for its violation.", 
                        "Section 1026.31(h) reflects this interpretation by requiring both appropriate restitution and the required adjustments to a loan to be completed within a reasonable time. What length of time is reasonable may depend on the circumstances, including the nature of the violation at stake. The Bureau therefore declines to provide detailed guidance on what periods would be reasonable. However, as the accompanying new comment 31(h)-1 notes, the Bureau generally regards 30 days after the consumer sends notice of the chosen adjustment as reasonable.", 
                        "Comment 31(h)-1 also provides a clarifying interpretation of the notice and election procedures. Section 129(v) is also ambiguous as to how consumers are to be notified that they have a choice of remedy and how they are to inform creditors of their choice. The Bureau believes that Congress intended for consumers to have a reasonable opportunity to make a choice under section 129(v). In the Bureau's view, this purpose is effectuated by interpreting section 129(v) to require a creditor or assignee to provide adequate notice of the choices available to the consumer. Specifically, comment 31(h)-1 notes that the initial notice sent to the consumer should be in writing, should offer the consumer the proposed adjustments, and should state the time within which the consumer must choose an adjustment. Comment 31(h)-1 further explains that the Bureau regards 60 days as generally sufficient to provide adequate notice of the consumer's right to make an election.", 
                        "Finally, the Bureau is clarifying in \u00a7 1026.31(h) and its accompanying commentary certain statutory terminology for consistency with existing Regulation Z terminology, and to reflect the Dodd-Frank Act's expansion of loans potentially subject to HOEPA coverage to include open-end credit plans. Thus, \u00a7 1026.31(h) and its accompanying commentary use the terms \u201cconsummation or account opening\u201d and \u201cloan or credit plan\u201d to clarify that \u00a7 1026.31(h) applies to both closed-end and open-end credit."

                        "Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, the statutory protections for high cost mortgages generally were limited to closed-end refinancings and home-equity mortgage loans with APRs or points and fees that exceeded the thresholds prescribed by TILA section 103(aa), as implemented by existing \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1). The Dodd-Frank Act expanded HOEPA's coverage by providing in TILA section 103(bb)(1) that the term \u201chigh-cost mortgage\u201d means any consumer credit transaction that is secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, other than a reverse mortgage transaction, if any of the prescribed high-cost mortgage thresholds are met. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i) through (iii), below, the Dodd-Frank Act adjusted HOEPA's existing APR and points and fees thresholds and added a third HOEPA coverage test based on a transaction's prepayment penalties.", 
                        "The proposal would have revised \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1) to implement TILA's amended definition of \u201chigh-cost mortgage\u201d by removing the coverage exclusions for residential mortgage transactions (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> purchase-money mortgage loans) and HELOCs while retaining the exclusion of reverse mortgage transactions. Specifically, the proposal would have defined &#8220;high-cost mortgage&#8221; in &#167; 1026.32(a)(1) to mean any consumer credit transaction, other than a reverse mortgage transaction as defined in &#167; 1026.33(a), that is secured by the consumer's principal dwelling and in which any one of the high-cost APR, points and fees, or prepayment penalty coverage tests is met. Proposed comment 32(a)(1)-1 would have clarified that a high-cost mortgage includes both a closed- and open-end credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. The comment also would have clarified that, for purposes of determining coverage under &#167; 1026.32, an open-end credit transaction is limited to account opening; an individual advance of funds or a draw on the credit line subsequent to account opening does not constitute a &#8220;transaction&#8221; for this purpose. As noted in the proposal, the Bureau believes that such a clarification is needed to permit creditors to determine whether a HELOC is a high-cost mortgage once (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> at account opening), rather than having to evaluate the HELOC for high-cost mortgage coverage each time the consumer draws on the credit line.", 
                        "The Bureau received numerous comments concerning the proposed expanded scope of loan types covered by HOEPA. The Bureau addresses those coverage-related comments in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2) below. One commenter expressed an overall concern that the Bureau is not coordinating its 2013 HOEPA Final Rule with the implementation of other title XIV provisions, and suggested that HOEPA's protections were not necessary given these other provisions. As discussed in Part III of this preamble, the Bureau is carefully coordinating its rules.

Alternative 1 would have used the APR as the metric to be compared to the average prime offer rate for determining HOEPA coverage for both closed- and open-end credit transactions. Alternative 2 would have been substantially identical to Alternative 1, but it would have substituted a \u201ctransaction coverage rate\u201d for the APR as the metric to be compared to the average prime offer rate for closed-end credit transactions. The Bureau proposed Alternative 2 in connection with the Bureau's 2012 TILA-RESPA Integration Proposal, which would have broadened the general definition of finance charge for closed-end transactions under Regulation Z.\n             In its HOEPA proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on whether to adopt Alternative 1 or Alternative 2 for closed-end transactions. The Bureau also noted that it would not adopt Alternative 2 if it did not change the definition of finance charge in connection with the 2012 TILA-RESPA Integration Proposal. Proposed comment 32(a)(1)(i)-1 would have clarified how to determine the \u201ctransaction coverage rate\u201d for closed-end transactions if Alternative 2 were adopted.",

At that time, the Bureau noted that it would not be finalizing the more inclusive finance charge in January 2013.\n\n             The Bureau therefore does not address in this rulemaking the numerous public comments that it received concerning the proposed alternatives for the APR coverage test. The Bureau instead will address such comments in connection with its finalization of the 2012 TILA-RESPA Integration Proposal, thus resolving that issue together with the Bureau's determination whether to adopt the more inclusive finance charge.

                                "The Bureau received several comments generally discussing the use of the APR for determining HOEPA coverage. One State housing finance authority commenter suggested that the Bureau replace the APR-based coverage test for both closed- and open-end transactions with a simpler, interest rate-based test that would be easier to explain to consumers and would eliminate regional variations due to closing charges. Given that TILA clearly contemplates an APR-based coverage test for determining the applicability of HOEPA protections, as well as other types of special protections, the Bureau declines to adopt an interest rate-based test for high-cost mortgages in this rulemaking.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Bureau also declines to adopt in the final rule, as suggested by one consumer advocacy commenter, a requirement that non-interest finance charge items be included in the APR calculation for HELOCs for purposes of determining HOEPA coverage. As noted, the Dodd-Frank Act expanded HOEPA coverage to HELOCs in TILA section 103(bb)(1)(A). In doing so, Congress did not set forth any special standards for applying the APR coverage test to open-end credit. Under the HOEPA proposal, HELOC creditors thus would have tested HELOCs for HOEPA coverage by using the standard APR that creditors calculate for HELOC disclosures. Specifically, unlike for closed-end transactions, where the APR reflects costs other than interest, HELOC APRs include only interest.\n             One consumer group commenter urged the Bureau to make the APR coverage test more consistent between closed- and open-end credit by adopting a more inclusive APR calculation for HELOCs. The commenter argued that, under the Bureau's proposal, a creditor could impose astronomical closing costs on a HELOC without meeting the APR coverage test, because such charges are not included in the APR calculation for HELOCs. The commenter expressed concern that the difference in the APR calculation for HELOCs versus closed-end transactions will unduly encourage creditors to steer consumers toward HELOCs, and particularly to HELOCs with excessively high closing costs.", 
                                "The Bureau acknowledges that Regulation Z requires a different calculation of APR for closed-end transactions (interest rate plus other charges) than for HELOCs (interest rate only) for disclosure purposes. Using these existing APRs for HOEPA coverage necessarily means that non-interest charges will be reflected in the APR for closed-end, but not for open-end, transactions. The Bureau declines at this time, however, to adopt a different APR for HELOCs. First, the Bureau notes that creditors have been required to use the (interest rate) APR for HELOC disclosures for more than twenty years, and this APR is consistent with the APR used for other open-end credit.\n\n             Moreover, notwithstanding the commenter's concern, the Bureau believes that the HOEPA points and fees coverage test should constrain HELOC creditors from imposing excessively high closing costs. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(2) below, the final rule adopts a points and fees definition that is the same in all material respects for closed- and open-end credit. Finally, the Bureau believes that introducing a new APR calculation for HELOC creditors solely for determining HOEPA coverage could impose additional compliance costs that would need to be carefully analyzed. Thus, the Bureau believes that comments concerning the disparity between the APR for closed- and open-end credit transactions are better considered as part of a broader reevaluation of the HELOC provisions of Regulation Z, rather than in the context of this rulemaking to implement section 1431 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n            \n          "

The Bureau is not aware of any publicly available and authoritative surveys of pricing data for HELOCs from which to calculate a separate average prime offer rate for open-end credit.\n             Proposed comment 32(a)(1)(i)-3 therefore would have instructed creditors to test HELOCs for HOEPA coverage by comparing the HELOC's APR (calculated in accordance with proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)\n            ) to the average prime offer rate for \u201cthe most closely comparable closed-end loan\u201d based on applicable loan characteristics and other loan pricing terms. Proposed comment 32(a)(1)(i)-3 would have provided illustrative examples to facilitate compliance.", 
                                "The proposal explained why the Bureau believes that it is reasonable to require HELOC creditors to use the average prime offer rate for the most closely-comparable closed-end loan when determining HELOC coverage. The Bureau noted its belief that market rates for HELOCs generally are based on a prime lending rate, such as the average prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal.\n\n             When the Bureau compared the prime rate published by the Board over a 12-year period to average prime offer rates for annually-adjusting, closed-end credit transactions (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> one-year adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs)) for the same period, the Bureau found that the rates generally were comparable. Thus, the Bureau believes that using the average prime offer rate for the most closely-comparable closed-end loan is a reasonable benchmark for HOEPA's APR test for HELOCs. The Bureau further believes that requiring HELOC creditors to use this benchmark will facilitate compliance because HELOC creditors may use existing rate-spread calculators on the FFIEC's Web site to determine HOEPA coverage. Finally, the Bureau believes that requiring HELOC creditors to use the closed-end, average prime offer rate tables is appropriate under TILA section 103(bb)(1)(A)(i), which requires a comparison of a mortgage transaction's APR to the average prime offer rate without distinguishing between closed- and open-end credit. The Bureau nevertheless solicited data or comment on all aspects of determining the average prime offer rate for HELOCs. In particular, the Bureau solicited comment on whether a benchmark other than the average prime offer rate for the most closely-comparable closed-end loan would better meet the objectives of HOEPA's APR coverage test for HELOCs and facilitate compliance.", 
                                "Commenters generally did not object to changing the benchmark for HOEPA's APR coverage test from the yield on Treasury securities to the average prime offer rate.\n\n             Indeed, several industry commenters specifically supported the change, noting that the average prime offer rate tracks market prices better than the yield on Treasury securities. One such industry commenter noted that, under recent market conditions, the maximum APR for HOEPA coverage for a first-lien, 10-year, fixed-rate mortgage would be higher under the HOEPA Proposal (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> 6.5 percentage points over the average prime offer rate) than under existing &#167; 1026.32(a)(1)(i) (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> eight percentage points over the yield on comparable Treasuries). Specifically, the commenter stated that, under the HOEPA Proposal, the maximum APR for HOEPA coverage for this transaction would be 10.42 percent, whereas the maximum APR under existing &#167; 1026.32(a)(1)(i) would be 9.70 percent.", 
                                "Another industry commenter observed that using the average prime offer rate as the benchmark will not be difficult because the average prime offer rate has been used for some time as the benchmark for determining coverage under Regulation Z's higher-priced mortgage loan rules in existing \u00a7 1026.35. The commenter, however, suggested that the Bureau work with the FFIEC to ensure that the rate-spread calculator currently employed for purposes of determining higher-priced mortgage loan coverage would be adjusted and usable for purposes of determining HOEPA coverage.", 
                                "Two commenters urged the Bureau to harmonize the methodologies for calculating the average prime offer rate and the APR for adjustable-rate mortgages under \u00a7 1026.32(a)(3). These commenters stated that, for example, if the APR for an adjustable-rate transaction for purposes of determining HOEPA coverage is determined under \u00a7 1026.32(a)(3) based on the higher of the initial interest rate or the fully-indexed rate, then the applicable average prime offer rate should be calculated in the same way to ensure that there is a more accurate comparison for purposes of the HOEPA coverage calculation.", 
                                "Several industry commenters, while not objecting to the use of an average prime offer rate benchmark for HELOCs, urged the Bureau to specify in the final rule (or work to develop) a separate methodology for calculating the average prime offer rate for open-end credit transactions. The commenters stated that it is not sensible to apply the average prime offer rate for closed-end credit transactions to HELOCs, because closed- and open-end mortgage products have different risks, pricing, and loan characteristics. The commenters did not suggest an alternative benchmark or any alternatives for calculating an average prime offer rate for HELOCs. One commenter suggested, however, that if the Bureau adopted \u201cthe most closely comparable closed-end loan\u201d standard as proposed, then the Bureau should specify how a creditor that originates a HELOC that could be comparable to multiple, different closed-end loans should determine which closed-end loan is the most closely comparable. Finally, one commenter requested guidance concerning the comparable maturity date for an \u201cevergreen\u201d HELOC (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> a HELOC with no scheduled maturity date) for which the interest rate may be fixed or adjustable.", 
                                "The Bureau is adopting the change in the APR benchmark from the yield on Treasury securities to the average prime offer rate as set forth in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i). The Bureau is finalizing proposed comments 32(a)(1)(i)-2 and -3 as comments 32(a)(1)(i)-1 and -2, respectively, for organizational purposes.\n             The Bureau makes certain other non-substantive changes to the proposed commentary for purposes of clarification. Specifically, the comments are reorganized, a cross-reference to comment 35(a)(2)-3 is added to comment 32(a)(1)(i)-2,\n             and comment 32(a)(1)(i)-3 is added to cross reference guidance in comment 35(a)(1)-2 on determining the date as of which creditors should compare a transaction's APR to the average prime offer rate. Finally, as discussed further below, additional guidance concerning how a HELOC creditor should determine the most closely comparable closed-end mortgage loan is added to comment 32(a)(1)(i)-2.", 
                                "In response to commenters' suggestions that the FFIEC rate-spread calculator be adapted for use in determining HOEPA coverage, the Bureau does not anticipate difficulties in using the calculator for this purpose. The calculator exists on the FFIEC Web site primarily for use in determining the \u201crate spread\u201d that must be reported, if any, under HMDA and Regulation C, 12 CFR part 1003. Specifically Regulation C \u00a7 1003.4(a)(12) requires HMDA reporters to report the spread between a loan's APR and the applicable average prime offer rate (determined identically to the determination for higher-priced mortgage loans under \u00a7 1026.35) if that spread exceeds 1.5 percentage points for a first-lien loan or 3.5 percentage points for a subordinate-lien loan. Those spreads match the spreads that historically have applied for higher-priced mortgage loan coverage determinations under \u00a7 1026.35(a)(2), allowing creditors to use the calculator to determine whether a transaction is a higher-priced mortgage loan.\n             Creditors may accomplish this by noting whether the calculator yields a rate spread for reporting under HMDA (which means the transaction is a higher-priced mortgage loan) or \u201cN/A\u201d for HMDA reporting purposes (which means the transaction is not a higher-priced mortgage loan). From there, it is a simple step further to note whether any rate spread the calculator yields for HMDA reporting purposes exceeds 6.5 or 8.5 percentage points over the average prime offer rate, as applicable, to know whether the transaction is a high-cost mortgage under \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i).", 
                                "The Bureau acknowledges, as noted by a commenter, that the APR calculation required by \u00a7 1026.32(a)(3) for determining HOEPA coverage for a variable-rate transaction generally requires a creditor to use the fully-indexed rate, whereas blended APRs (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> APRs that take low introductory rates into consideration) are used to calculate average prime offer rates. The Bureau nevertheless finalizes the rule as proposed. The Bureau believes that APRs (and thus average prime offer rates) calculated pursuant to the blended method are unlikely in most cases to be significantly lower than APRs calculated using the fully-indexed rate.\n             Moreover, the methodology for calculating the average prime offer rate was well-established when Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act and affirmatively (1) incorporated the average prime offer rate as the benchmark for the APR trigger; and (2) required the use of the fully-indexed rate for determining the APR for variable-rate transactions.", 
                                "Finally, the Bureau does not at this time adopt a separate methodology for determining the average prime offer rate for HELOCs. Based on available data, the Bureau continues to believe that using the average prime offer rate for the most closely-comparable, closed-end credit transaction is a reasonable benchmark for HOEPA's APR test for HELOCs. The fact that HELOCs are tied to a prime rate which, over a 12-year period, was generally comparable to the average prime offer rate for one-year ARMs informs the Bureau's conclusion. In addition, as discussed above, the average prime offer rate tables are published with a rate-spread calculator that determines the average prime offer rate for the most comparable closed-end credit transaction and automatically compares it to a transaction's APR and lien status to determine the transaction's APR's spread over the applicable average prime offer rate. This calculator can easily be used by creditors originating HELOCs.", 
                                "Specifically, as described in further detail in comment 32(a)(1)(i)-2, a HELOC creditor should use the published rate-spread calculator to identify the average prime offer rate for the most closely-comparable closed-end credit transaction by inputting the same terms that would be required to determine the most comparable transaction for any closed-end origination. These terms are: (1) Whether the HELOC is fixed- or variable-rate; (2) if the HELOC is fixed-rate, the term to maturity; (3) if the HELOC is variable-rate, the duration of any initial, fixed-rate period; and (4) the date that the interest rate for the transaction is set. Finally, comment 32(a)(1)(i)-2 clarifies that a creditor originating a fixed-rate, evergreen HELOC should enter a term of 30 years.\n             The Bureau believes that 30 years is a reasonable proxy for the term of an evergreen HELOC given that 30 years is the longest term to maturity for conventional mortgage loans.\n            \n          "

Pursuant to its authority under TILA section 103(aa)(2) (re-designated by the Dodd-Frank Act as section 103(bb)(2)), the Board in 2001 lowered the APR threshold for first-lien transactions to 8 percentage points above the yield on comparable Treasury securities and retained the higher APR threshold of 10 percentage points above the yield on comparable Treasury securities for subordinate-lien transactions, thus creating a two-tiered APR test for HOEPA coverage.\n             The APR thresholds are implemented in existing \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i).",

Thus, under TILA section 103(bb)(1)(A)(i)(I), the APR percentage-point threshold for HOEPA coverage for most first-lien transactions (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> all first-lien, real property-secured transactions, as well as first-lien, personal property-secured transactions for $50,000 or more) is 6.5 percentage points over the average prime offer rate.",

The Bureau did not propose any adjustments to the 6.5 percentage-point APR threshold prescribed by the Dodd-Frank Act for either closed- or open-end transactions.

These commenters generally asserted that the existing threshold has worked well to date, that the Bureau has provided no empirical evidence demonstrating that the threshold needs to be adjusted, and that the enhanced HOEPA protections that the Bureau is finalizing in this rulemaking obviate any need to reduce the threshold. One industry commenter argued that increased coverage under the revised HOEPA coverage tests generally would interfere with the goal of the Bureau's 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal by eliminating a consumer's ability to shop for and obtain a mortgage near HOEPA's amended thresholds.",

The Bureau has authority under TILA section 103(bb)(2)(A) to increase or decrease this APR threshold from the level set forth in the statute to a level between 6 and 10 percentage points above the average prime offer rate. However, prior to making such an adjustment, the Bureau must find that an increase or decrease from the statutory level is consistent with consumer protection and warranted by the need for credit. As noted, both consumer group and industry commenters suggested various adjustments to the threshold or suggested that the existing threshold should not be adjusted in light of protections. None of these commenters, however, provided data or other specific information to indicate how much of an adjustment from the level prescribed by Congress is warranted by a need for access to credit or to protect consumers from abusive lending.", 
                        "As to the consumer group comment suggesting that the Bureau decrease the APR threshold by several percentage points, the Bureau notes that, under TILA section 103(bb)(2)(B)(i), it does not have authority to reduce the threshold below 6 percentage points above the average prime offer rate. Even for adjustments that would lower the APR threshold within the permitted range (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> from the statutory 6.5 percentage points to an adjusted 6 percentage points above the average prime offer rate), the Bureau does not believe that it has sufficient information at this time to justify such a departure based on the need to protect consumers from abusive lending.", 
                        "As to industry commenters' general argument that the Bureau should maintain the threshold at its existing (pre-Dodd-Frank) level or increase it, the Bureau believes that implementing the APR percentage-point threshold at its statutorily-prescribed level, without any adjustment, is particularly appropriate at this time given the simultaneous change in the benchmark for HOEPA coverage from the yield on Treasury securities to the average prime offer rate. The Bureau believes there are several advantages of using the average prime offer rate rather than the yield on Treasury securities including, as one industry commenter noted, that the average prime offer rate more closely tracks movements in mortgage rates than do yields on Treasury securities.\n             With this change to the benchmark, then, it is not clear that revising the threshold from an eight percentage-point spread to a 6.5 percentage-point spread will result in unwarranted HOEPA coverage. Indeed, as noted in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i) above, one industry commenter observed that the maximum APR for HOEPA coverage may, depending on market conditions, be higher in certain circumstances under the final rule than under existing \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i). Of course, if the Bureau observes an increase in coverage to a degree that interferes with access to credit, the Bureau has authority to increase the threshold as appropriate at that time.",

For example, the commenters stated that such loans tend to carry more credit risk and have not benefited from secondary market funding to the same degree as site-built housing, thus increasing creditors' cost of funds. According to one commenter, an APR of 14.73 percent therefore is necessary to offer a manufactured home loan on a profitable basis. Industry commenters estimated that, under the HOEPA proposal, between 32 and 48 percent of their recent manufactured home loan originations would have been covered by the APR thresholds if the Bureau adopted the thresholds as proposed. In contrast, these commenters stated that, if the Bureau adopted an APR threshold of 10 percentage points above the average prime offer rate for all home purchase transactions secured in whole or in part by manufactured housing, then only between 12 and 15 percent of manufactured home loans would be covered under the APR test. They also stated that, if the Bureau adopted an APR threshold of 12 percentage points above the average prime offer rate for all manufactured home loans, then only between 2 and 3 percent of manufactured home loans would be covered.", 
                        "The Bureau acknowledges the concerns raised by manufactured housing industry commenters concerning HOEPA coverage. In the Bureau's view, however, Congress weighed the interests of consumers and creditors concerning the costs and risks associated with manufactured housing loans by specifying a higher APR threshold of 8.5 percentage points above the average prime offer rate for personal property-secured loans with a loan amount of $50,000 or less. (At today's rates, for a 10- or 15-year, fixed-rate loan, the 8.5 percentage-point threshold translates into an APR of approximately 12.5 or 11.25 percent, respectively.) The Bureau thus declines to depart from the APR thresholds prescribed by Congress. The Bureau's analysis was informed by the following considerations.", 
                        "First, the Bureau understands that manufactured homes may be titled either as personal property (in which case the consumer receives a personal property, or chattel, loan) or as real property (in which case the consumer receives a mortgage). Whether a manufactured home is titled as personal or real property does not perfectly correlate to whether the consumer owns the land on which the home is situated. Indeed, according to 2011 U.S. Census data, even though a majority (77 percent) of new manufactured homes placed during 2011 were titled as personal property, only 26 percent were placed inside manufactured home (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> land-lease) communities, with the balance being placed on owned land.\n\n             Instead, as noted by consumer group commenters, the laws in most States provide an option for titling the manufactured home either as personal or real property.", 
                        "In seeking relief from the APR thresholds, industry commenters noted that the average price of a new manufactured home is approximately $60,600 and that the majority of their originations were secured by homes titled as personal property. The commenters, however, did not specify what portion of their loans would be subject to HOEPA coverage under the 6.5 percentage-point APR threshold, as opposed to the 8.5 percentage-point threshold for smaller-dollar, personal property-secured transactions. Instead, they requested that the Bureau adopt an across-the-board APR threshold of 10 or 12 percentage points above the average prime offer rate for all manufactured housing. (At today's rates, these thresholds translate into APRs of roughly 13 and 15 percent for a 15-year, fixed-rate loan.)", 
                        "The Bureau understands that, as the commenters described, there tend to be greater costs associated with originating loans secured by manufactured housing, particularly when such loans secured solely by personal property. However, the Bureau does not have authority under HOEPA to increase the APR threshold for first-lien transactions to more than 10 percentage points above the average prime offer rate. Moreover, the higher threshold set forth by Congress for smaller-dollar, personal property loans appears to be consistent with the lower range of estimates of the increased rates that are associated with personal property loans.\n            \n          ", 
                        "For first-lien loans other than those eligible for the higher threshold, the Bureau has been unable to determine from the commenters' estimates what portion of the existing APRs for manufactured home loans is attributable to the factors cited by the commenters, such as credit risk and lack of a robust secondary market.\n            \n          ", 
                        "The Bureau notes that in the current market, 10- or 15-year, fixed-rate manufactured home loans secured by real property (or by personal property where the loan amount is $50,000 or more) would not fall within HOEPA's APR coverage threshold unless they had APRs of greater than approximately 10.5 or 9.25 percent, respectively. The Bureau does not believe that it has sufficient data to determine whether an adjustment to this statutory threshold is needed to compensate for legitimate cost factors, or how large such an adjustment should be.", 
                        "Moreover, the Bureau is not certain that manufactured home creditors would cease originating loans even if a portion of those loans exceed the high-cost mortgage APR threshold. Some industry commenters argued that they would not originate high-cost mortgages because complying with the restrictions and requirements (particularly the pre-loan counseling requirement) would be cost prohibitive. At the same time, however, industry commenters stated that manufactured home loans typically do not contain the types of loan terms that would be prohibited for high-cost mortgages. In addition, while the pre-loan counseling requirement will entail recordkeeping and data retention costs, the Bureau notes that creditors are not required to cover the cost of counseling.", 
                        "In sum, prior to adjusting the APR percentage point threshold for all manufactured home loans, the Bureau would need additional information showing why it is cost-prohibitive in today's market for a manufactured home lender to originate a first-lien, real property-secured manufactured home (or a personal property-secured loan for greater than $50,000) with an APR of approximately 10.5 percent or less. For all of these reasons, the final rule adopts \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i)(A) as proposed."

As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i)(A) above, the APR threshold in TILA section 103(bb)(1)(A)(i)(I) for smaller first-lien loans secured by personal property thus establishes a higher threshold for such loans than the 6.5 percentage-point APR threshold for other first-lien transactions.",

For example, proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i)(B) would have referred to a \u201cfirst-lien transaction\u201d instead of a \u201cfirst mortgage.\u201d In addition, proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i)(B) would have referred to the transaction's \u201ctotal loan amount\u201d rather than its \u201ctotal transaction amount.\u201d Proposed comment 32(a)(1)(i)-4 would have stated that the phrase \u201ctotal loan amount\u201d as used in \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i)(B) should be interpreted consistently with the guidance for \u201ctotal loan amount\u201d set forth in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(6) and comment 32(b)(6)-1.\n            \n          ",

                        "The Bureau received several public comments concerning the higher APR percentage-point threshold in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i)(B). Industry commenters generally did not distinguish between the 6.5 and 8.5 percentage-point APR thresholds for first-lien transactions, and those comments are addressed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i)(A) above. However, at least one industry commenter requested that the Bureau adjust the $50,000 cut-off for the 8.5 percentage-point threshold to $125,000.", 
                        "Consumer groups generally urged the Bureau not to adopt the higher, statutory APR threshold as proposed in \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i)(B) unless and until the Bureau finds after further research that the higher threshold is necessary. Several of these commenters argued that the higher threshold is not sensible because it applies to loans that are most likely to be obtained by the most vulnerable and lowest-income consumers. In addition, certain commenters argued that the higher threshold could incentivize manufactured home creditors to steer consumers to title their manufactured homes as personal property in the approximately 42 States that permit a manufactured home owner to title the home as either personal or real property. The commenters stated that steering of this type would be harmful to consumers because loans secured by personal property tend to be more expensive than mortgages secured by real property, and loans secured by personal property also have fewer legal protections than other mortgages.\n             Many of the consumer group commenters argued that, to promote a level playing field for low-income consumers and to prevent steering, all first-lien transactions should have the same APR threshold, irrespective of the amount borrowed and collateral type.", 
                        "In contrast, one consumer group commenter, while agreeing with concerns about steering, nevertheless believed that the higher APR for smaller-dollar-amount, personal property-secured loans was warranted given market conditions and creditors' cost of funds. This commenter opposed any increase in the higher APR threshold beyond what is provided in the statute. This commenter based its recommendation on anecdotal evidence obtained by consulting with a sample of single-family manufactured home loan originators,\n             all of whom opposed raising the APR threshold higher than 8.5 percentage points above the average prime offer rate.", 
                        "As provided by TILA section 103(bb)(1)(i)(A)(I), the final rule adopts in \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i)(B) the higher APR threshold of 8.5 percentage points over the average prime offer rate for first-lien loans secured by personal property and with a loan amount of less than $50,000. The Bureau understands that this separate threshold was designed to reflect costs associated with smaller-dollar, personal property loans.", 
                        "The Bureau shares commenters' concerns that a higher percentage-point threshold for personal property-secured loans could, if set too high, exacerbate incentives for creditors to steer consumers into titling their homes as personal property. The Bureau understands that such steering can and does currently occur in the market. Indeed, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approved in July 2012 a Uniform Manufactured Housing Act that would simplify and streamline State laws to convert manufactured homes titled as personal property to real property and would prohibit manufactured home sellers from steering consumers to chattel loans rather than mortgages.\n             As noted, personal property-secured loans tend to offer consumers fewer legal protections, so a rule that permits HOEPA coverage to turn on how the loan is titled, and that therefore potentially incentivizes steering to personal property-secured loans, could be disadvantageous to some consumers. However, because personal property-secured loans generally have had costs roughly 2 to 5 percent higher than mortgages (as noted in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i)(A) above) the Bureau does not believe that implementing the 2 percentage-point higher threshold for such loans will exacerbate any steering that may already be occurring in the market. On balance, then, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to effectuate the higher APR threshold for smaller-dollar, personal-property secured loans in light of the higher costs occurring in the market for such loans. In light of the fact that Congress set forth a clear line for this threshold, and in the absence of specific evidence demonstrating another line that would better protect consumers while maintaining access to credit, the Bureau declines to adjust the statutory threshold.", 
                        "The Bureau adopts proposed comment 32(a)(1)(i)-4 explaining how to determine the \u201cloan amount\u201d for purposes of the $50,000 cut-off, but re-numbers it as comment 32(a)(1)(i)(B)-1 for organizational purposes. In the final rule, the Bureau also clarifies that the $50,000 refers to the face amount of the note, rather than (as proposed) the \u201ctotal loan amount.\u201d The \u201ctotal loan amount\u201d is a defined term used in connection with calculating whether a transaction meets the percentage point thresholds in the points and fees coverage test. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(ii) below, the points and fees coverage test adopts the face of amount of the note as the relevant metric for determining whether a loan is above or below the $20,000 cut-off between the 5 percent and 8 percent points and fees tests. The face amount of the note is adopted in that context for consistency with the approach adopted in the points and fees provisions of the 2013 ATR Final Rule. The Bureau believes that a consistent approach to determining whether a transaction is above or below a particular dollar-value threshold will facilitate compliance with Regulation Z. Thus, upon further consideration, the Bureau specifies in the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule that the face amount of the note also is the appropriate amount for a creditor to reference in determining whether to apply the 6.5 or 8.5 APR percentage-point threshold for HOEPA coverage."

Some industry commenters expressed particular concern about smaller transactions, including loans originated by Housing Finance Agencies and under the USDA Rural Housing Program. One such commenter argued that the 5 percent points and fees threshold would be most problematic for loan amounts below approximately $60,000 and stated that the threshold would drive creditors to impose strict minimum loan amounts on their mortgage originations. Industry commenters generally acknowledged a good deal of uncertainty in estimating the potential impact of the revised points and fees thresholds given that the Bureau had not yet finalized the Dodd-Frank Act's amendments to the definition of points and fees. (As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1) and (2) below, the Dodd-Frank Act amended the definition of points and fees to remove certain items that previously would have been counted (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> certain mortgage insurance premiums and bona fide discount points) and to add other items (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> the maximum prepayment penalties that may be charged).

                                "As in the case of the APR coverage test, manufactured housing industry commenters expressed concern about HOEPA coverage of manufactured home loans under the points and fees coverage test. These commenters estimated that anywhere from 24 to 51 percent of their manufactured home originations during 2010 and 2011 would have been covered under the proposal's points and fees threshold. (Commenters did not specify what percentage of their loans would have been subject to the 5 percent or 8 percent thresholds.) Commenters explained that manufactured home loans, particularly those secured by personal property, tend to be for smaller amounts than real property-secured loans. However, according to these commenters, the cost of originating and servicing a loan of $200,000 and a loan of $20,000 is essentially the same in terms of absolute dollars. They asserted that because the cost of origination as a percentage of loan size thus is significantly higher for smaller loans, transactions with small loan amounts should not be treated the same for purposes of the points and fees test. Commenters suggested that adjusting the points and fees threshold for purchase-money mortgages secured in whole or in part by manufactured housing would ensure consumer protection while maximizing credit availability. For example, one commenter estimated that, if the Bureau applied a points and fees test of the greater of (1) 5 percent of the total loan amount or $3,000, or (2) 5 percent of the total loan amount or $5,000, to all purchase-money mortgages secured in whole or in part by manufactured housing, then 41 percent or 22 percent of all manufactured housing loans, respectively, would be covered under the points and fees test.",

The Bureau recognizes that points and fees comprise, in part, a means of recovering costs that may constitute a larger percentage of the loan amount for smaller loans. However, as is the case of the APR coverage test, Congress already adjusted the points and fees test to account for this fact by setting the threshold for loans of less than $20,000 higher than the threshold for all other loans. The Bureau would need to exercise its exception authority under TILA section 105(a) to adjust the thresholds beyond what Congress provided and, in turn, would need data or specific information showing that a departure from the levels set by Congress is warranted. Commenters presented some information indicating that, in a significant percentage of smaller transactions made by some lenders, points and fees currently are charged that exceed the threshold established by Congress. However, neither this information nor any other data available to the Bureau establishes that application of the statutory threshold will cause these lenders to cease making these loans. Moreover, commenters did not provide, and the Bureau is not otherwise aware of data or other information that would support, specific numeric thresholds different than those provided by Congress. The Bureau understands commenters' concerns that, if lenders choose to impose strict lending limits, that could have fair lending implications, because low- to moderate-income families and minorities could be more likely to suffer disproportionately. On the other hand, the Bureau is mindful of concerns raised by consumer groups that these are the very populations that need extra protections that are afforded by laws such as HOEPA. The Bureau believes that the points and fees coverage test is important in ensuring that loans with high upfront costs are subject to such special protections, and in the Bureau's view, the commenters did not present a persuasive case that implementing the statutory thresholds would adversely affect credit availability. In addition, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1) and (2) below, the Bureau notes that it is adopting several limitations and clarifications to the definition of points and fees in response to industry commenters' concerns (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> by specifying that only such fees that are known at or before consummation must be included in the calculation). The Bureau believes that those clarifications and limitations will address some of industry's concerns regarding unwarranted coverage through points and fees.", 
                                "The Bureau similarly is not persuaded that a different, higher points and fees threshold should apply to manufactured home loans. As noted, manufactured housing industry commenters suggested that the Bureau implement a points and fees threshold for all loans secured in whole or in part by manufactured housing (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> for any real- or personal property-secured transaction) of (at least) the greater of 5 percent of the total loan amount or $3,000. Under this suggested approach, all loans secured by manufactured housing with loan amounts less than $60,000 could charge points and fees of $3,000 without triggering HOEPA coverage. The Bureau notes that the $3,000 amount becomes an increasingly large percent of the loan amount as the loan size decreases. Thus, for the smallest loans (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> those that would be expected, for example, to be made to the most vulnerable consumers purchasing used manufactured homes on land that they do not own) the suggested points and fees could reach up to 60 percent of the loan amount.\n             Manufactured housing industry commenters argued, as did other industry commenters, that points and fees naturally comprise a larger percent of the loan amount as loan amounts decrease in size. However, they did not provide specific evidence indicating that smaller manufactured home loans (let alone all manufactured home loans) have characteristics that merit a different points and fees threshold than other, smaller transactions. In short, in light of the fact that Congress articulated a specific points and fees threshold for smaller transactions, and in the absence of specific evidence indicating a more appropriate threshold, the Bureau adopts in the final rule the points and fees thresholds as set forth in the statute."

As noted in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i)(B) above, in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau is providing that a creditor must determine which points and fees tier applies to a transaction for purposes of the qualified mortgage points and fees test by using the face amount of the note (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> the &#8220;loan amount&#8221; as defined in &#167; 1026.43(b)(5)). <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> the section-by-section analysis of &#167; 1026.43(e)(3)(i) in the 2013 ATR Final Rule.

As noted above, the Bureau received a significant number of comments expressing concern about the points and fees coverage test for smaller transactions. The Bureau believes that adopting this final rule without providing for the $20,000 to be adjusted for inflation would, over time, discourage some creditors from making smaller loans, to the detriment of consumers, without providing any meaningful corresponding consumer protection benefit.

Notwithstanding that a small number of commenters expressed general dissatisfaction with the addition of a prepayment penalty coverage test for high-cost mortgages, particularly for smaller-dollar-amount transactions, the Bureau declines to depart from the statutory requirement to add the test. These commenters did not provide data to support the need either for a wholesale departure from the statute or, in the case of smaller loans, to warrant the increased regulatory complexity that would come with adding a separate prepayment penalty test for such transactions. Furthermore, the Bureau notes that, even if it were to adopt a narrower prepayment penalty test for HOEPA coverage, prepayment penalties still would be restricted by the bans and limitations that the Bureau is adopting for most closed-end transactions in its 2013 ATR Final Rule.", 
                        "As to the suggestion that the prepayment penalty test be based on information known as of consummation or account opening, the Bureau acknowledges that a creditor may not be able to determine whether a flat-rate prepayment penalty would exceed two percent of an \u201camount prepaid,\u201d when the \u201camount prepaid\u201d will not be known until the prepayment is made. However, the Bureau notes that, for a transaction with a prepayment penalty, creditors can ensure that they do not exceed the prepayment penalty coverage test by providing that any prepayment penalty (including any flat penalty) will not exceed 2 percent of the prepaid amount.", 
                        "Although the Bureau adopts the prepayment penalty coverage test in \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(iii) substantially as proposed, the Bureau adopts in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(6) a narrower definition of prepayment penalty. The final definition addresses comments concerning the inclusion of conditionally waived closing costs in prepayment penalties, particularly for smaller loans. The definition provides that certain conditionally-waived, bona fide third-party closing costs are not prepayment penalties. This approach ensures that bona fide third-party charges that would not be counted in points and fees if they were charged to the consumer upfront (<em data-original=\"E-03\">see, e.g.,</em> the section-by-section analysis of &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D)) also will not be counted in points and fees if they are waived on the condition that the consumer does not prepay the loan in full or terminate a HELOC during the first 36 months following consummation or account opening. This approach also should reduce the charges that count toward the high-cost mortgage prepayment penalty coverage test and at least partially address commenters' concerns regarding unwarranted coverage of smaller loans. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See also</em> the section-by-section analysis of &#167; 1026.32(b)(6) below."

                                "Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA excluded purchase-money mortgages from HOEPA coverage. The exclusion of purchase-money mortgages meant that specific types of lending were all but excluded from HOEPA coverage as a practical matter, if not by name. For example, refinancings of manufactured home loans and loans secured by other types of personal property (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> houseboats or recreational vehicles) historically were subject to HOEPA, but such loans are relatively rare. By amending TILA to remove the exclusion of purchase-money mortgages from HOEPA, the Dodd-Frank Act also removed the effective exclusion of manufactured home and personal property-secured loans from HOEPA. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of &#167; 1026.32(a)(1)(i)(A) and (B) above, Congress understood that expanding HOEPA to cover purchase-money transactions implicated such loans, because it created a specific APR coverage threshold for personal property-secured first-liens with a transaction amount of $50,000 or less.", 
                                "The HOEPA proposal did not propose specific relief from HOEPA coverage for manufactured home or personal property-secured loans beyond proposing to implement the separate, higher APR threshold set forth in the statute. As already discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i)(B) and (ii) above, the Bureau received public comments from both industry and consumer groups urging the Bureau to adjust the high-cost mortgage coverage tests as applied to manufactured housing. Numerous participants in the manufactured housing industry also requested that the Bureau exempt manufactured home loans from HOEPA coverage altogether. A few industry commenters similarly recommended that the Bureau exempt loans secured by personal property, such as houseboats and recreational vehicles, from HOEPA coverage.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Manufactured housing.</em> Industry commenters expressed serious concerns about the impact that the HOEPA proposal might have on the manufactured housing industry and on lower-income and rural consumers who rely on the manufactured home for affordable housing. Both industry and consumer group commenters noted that manufactured home loans primarily serve low- and moderate-income consumers in rural areas where access to other housing options and credit may be limited. Specifically, the Manufactured Housing Institute (MHI) estimated in its comment letter that there are approximately 9 million American families living in manufactured homes, that the average sales price of a new manufactured home is approximately $60,600, and that 60 percent of manufactured homes are located in rural areas. Moreover, according to 2011 census data as reported by MHI, in 2011 manufactured homes accounted for 46 percent of all new homes sold under $150,000, and 72 percent of all new homes sold under $125,000.", 
                                "Industry commenters estimated that, taking the HOEPA proposal's APR and points and fees thresholds together, between 44 and 75 percent of recent manufactured home loan originations would be covered by HOEPA. The commenters stated that they would not originate such loans. Commenters stated that the cost of originating high cost mortgages (particularly the costs of making additional disclosures and the pre-loan counseling requirement), the ongoing costs of monitoring loans for compliance with HOEPA, and the legal, regulatory, and reputational risks associated with HOEPA would prevent them from originating high cost mortgages. At least one commenter stated that Congress's inclusion of manufactured housing in HOEPA coverage must have been an oversight.", 
                                "Commenters thus suggested several ways that the Bureau might exempt manufactured housing from HOEPA coverage. Specifically, various commenters suggested exempting (1) All manufactured home loans, (2) purchase-money manufactured home loans, (3) personal property-secured manufactured home loans, or (4) real or personal property-secured manufactured home loans that do not contain terms or practices prohibited by HOEPA (for example, negative amortization or prepayment penalties). Commenters stated that the last exemption would be useful because, as a general matter, manufactured home loans do not contain such loan terms. Thus, consumers taking out manufactured home loans already are adequately protected, and manufactured home creditors would be relieved of the burden of monitoring for high-cost mortgage status and the attendant disclosures and other requirements (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> counseling) that come with such status. In the alternative, commenters suggested that the Bureau provide a temporary exemption for manufactured housing until the Bureau obtains and analyzes data concerning the need for a permanent exemption.", 
                                "The Bureau is finalizing \u00a7 1026.32(a) without any categorical exclusions for manufactured housing. Contrary to some industry commenters' suggestions, the plain language of HOEPA demonstrates that Congress specifically contemplated including manufactured home loans within HOEPA. The statutory definition of high-cost mortgage includes all consumer credit transactions secured by the consumer's principal dwelling (other than reverse mortgages); there is no limitation to real estate-secured loans. In fact, Congress specifically included an accommodation for a category of loans that are overwhelmingly comprised by manufactured housing loans by including a special, higher APR threshold for smaller transactions secured by personal property.", 
                                "The Bureau acknowledges that, as described by industry commenters, manufactured home loans may not contain certain risky features that HOEPA is designed to combat. However, these or other risky or abusive practices could arise in manufactured home lending (as with most lending) in the future. In addition, the Bureau believes that it would be imprudent to exempt manufactured home loans from HOEPA coverage when HOEPA offers some of the strongest consumer protections for loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling, when that dwelling is personal property. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i)(A), approximately 77 percent of manufactured homes placed in the U.S. during 2011 were titled as personal property.\n             State and Federal laws generally provide fewer legal protections for personal property-secured loans, including fewer required disclosures to assist consumers in understanding the terms of their credit transactions. For example, as discussed earlier, laws governing foreclosure procedures typically do not apply to loans secured by personal property, and RESPA only partially applies to such loans. The relative lack of protections for manufactured home loans distinguish manufactured housing from the other transaction types that this final rule exempts from HOEPA coverage, as discussed below. Moreover, consumers shopping for a manufactured home may have fewer financing options than those available for site-built dwellings, particularly when the home is titled as personal property. Lower-income consumers with limited financing options may be particularly susceptible to any abusive practices that might arise in the market. Finally, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i) and (ii) above, the Bureau is not persuaded that application of the HOEPA coverage thresholds will adversely affect access to manufactured home loans. The Bureau however, will monitor access to manufactured home credit. The Bureau believes that adjusting the coverage thresholds, if it obtains information indicating that such an adjustment is warranted, is more appropriate than adopting a wholesale exemption.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Personal property loans.</em> As noted, a few industry commenters urged the Bureau to exempt loans secured by personal property such as houseboats or recreational vehicles from coverage under the final high-cost mortgage rule, even if such property is the consumer's principal dwelling. The commenters stated that financing personal property is a separate line of business from mortgage lending, with different risks and pricing, and that vendors that finance such property may not have the capacity to comply with HOEPA. For the reasons just discussed with respect to manufactured housing, the Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate to exempt loans secured by personal property from the high-cost mortgage rules. The Bureau believes that Congress has already balanced the competing considerations regarding coverage of this type of lending, and that this balance is reflected in the special APR threshold for smaller dollar, personal property-secured loans."

Proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1) therefore would have expanded HOEPA coverage to all purchase-money transactions, including transactions to finance the initial construction of a consumer's principal dwelling. These \u201cconstruction loans\u201d can take different forms. In some cases, creditors may provide \u201cconstruction-only\u201d loans, where only the construction of the dwelling is financed by the creditor. These loans commonly contain balloon structures and are often refinanced into permanent loans after completion of the construction. In other cases, creditors may provide \u201cconstruction-to-permanent\u201d loans, where both the construction and the permanent financing are extended by the same creditor. For these loans\u2014which may be disclosed as two separate transactions or as a single transaction at the option of the creditor\u2014the construction financing typically rolls into a permanent financing at the end of the construction phase. The Bureau did not propose different treatment of construction loans in the HOEPA proposal.", 
                                "The Bureau received numerous comments from industry groups and banks, including a number of community banks, expressing concern that the expansion of HOEPA to include construction loans would unduly restrict access to home construction financing for consumers, with little to no corresponding consumer benefit. These commenters urged the Bureau to create an exemption to \u00a7 1026.32 for construction-only loans and the construction phase of construction-to-permanent loans, providing several bases for doing so.", 
                                "First, industry groups and community banks argued that the short term nature of construction financing as well as typically higher interest and administrative fees associated with construction-only loans or the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan would result in large numbers of these loans falling under the new HOEPA APR threshold. These commenters generally asserted that access to credit for these loans would be reduced because most creditors, as a matter of policy, do not make high-cost mortgages. They also noted that an additional barrier exists to making a construction-only loan as a high-cost mortgage, because construction-only loans are typically structured as balloons with terms of 1-2 years, and proposed \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1) would have prohibited any such balloon payments on high-cost mortgages. Thus, independent of the various reasons creditors typically refrain from making high-cost mortgages, creditors would be barred from making any such construction-only loan as a high-cost mortgage in its usual form. One large bank indicated that 20 percent of its 2009-2012 construction-only loans would have been classified as high-cost mortgages under the new HOEPA APR criteria, and that it would not have made those loans had HOEPA applied.", 
                                "Industry groups and community banks also asserted that construction loans should not be covered by HOEPA, largely because the predatory lending and abusive practices that compelled the passage of HOEPA do not exist for construction loans. Industry groups emphasized that construction loans typically involve more sophisticated consumers than ordinary residential mortgage loans and require more extensive coordination between the creditor, the home builder, and the home buyer, which they believe reduces the risk of abusive credit practices. As support for this position, these commenters noted that construction loans do not have the same history of abusive credit practices as other mortgage loans. In addition, industry groups argued that many of the protections afforded to borrowers under HOEPA\u2014such as restrictions on acceleration, charging of fees for loan modifications or payoff statements, and negative amortization features\u2014are generally inapplicable to construction loans.", 
                                "The Bureau notes that these comments are consistent with the discussion in the Board's 2008 HOEPA Final Rule, 73 FR 44522, 44539 (July 30, 2008), which exempted construction loans from the higher-priced mortgage loan rules (<em data-original=\"E-03\">see</em> &#167; 1026.35(a)(3)) for substantially the same reasons urged by industry. In that rule, the Board determined that construction loans typically have higher points, fees, and interest associated with them than other loan products, as well as shorter terms, which often results in construction loans having substantially higher APRs than other mortgage loan products. Thus, in the Board's view, applying &#167; 1026.35 to construction loans would have resulted in an excessive number of construction loans being classified as higher-priced mortgage loans, which could discourage some creditors from extending such financing. In addition, the Board also found that construction loans do not present the same risk of abuse as other mortgage loans, and concluded that applying the higher-priced mortgage loan rules to construction loans could hinder some borrowers' access to construction financing without meaningfully enhancing consumer protection. 73 FR at 44539. Upon careful consideration of the Board's rulemaking and the public comments received on the Bureau's 2012 HOEPA Proposal, the Bureau similarly concludes that an exemption from HOEPA is warranted for construction loans.", 
                                "The Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(ii) to exempt from HOEPA coverage loans to finance the initial construction of a consumer's principal residence, which includes both construction-only loans and the construction phase of construction-to-permanent loans. The Bureau is exempting such loans from coverage pursuant to its authority under TILA section 105(a), which grants the Bureau authority to exempt all or any class of transactions where necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA, to prevent evasion, or to facilitate compliance. The Bureau believes that exempting construction loans from the HOEPA restrictions set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 1026.32 and 1026.34 is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of, and to facilitate compliance with, TILA, in accordance with TILA section 105(a). The Bureau believes that concerns discussed in the 2008 HOEPA Rule, such as hindering access to credit without meaningfully enhancing consumer protection, are equally applicable to construction financing transactions that otherwise would be high-cost mortgages. The Bureau further believes that adopting this final rule without an exemption for construction loans would discourage some creditors from participation in the construction financing business, thereby reducing competition to the detriment of consumers, without providing any meaningful corresponding consumer protection benefit. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that an exemption for construction loans will strengthen competition among financial institutions and promote economic stabilization.", 
                                "The Bureau also is adopting comment 32(a)(2)(ii)-1 to provide further guidance on how the exemption applies to construction-to-permanent loans. Comment 32(a)(2)(ii)-1 explains that the \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(ii) exemption applies to both a construction-only loan and to the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan. However, the permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether extended by the same or a different creditor, is not exempt from HOEPA coverage. Under \u00a7 1026.17(c)(6)(ii), a creditor has the option to treat a construction-to-permanent loan as a single transaction or as multiple transactions for disclosure purposes, even when the same creditor extends both loans and a single closing occurs. Because only the construction phase is exempt from \u00a7 1026.32, the Bureau recognizes that the rule could present an incentive to creditors to shift all or most upfront charges to the construction phase. However, the Bureau remains persuaded that construction loans do not present the same risk of abuse as do other loans. The Bureau also believes that market competition should minimize creditors' ability to engage in such evasion because those creditors should be unable to capture much of the construction market where other creditors offering construction-only financing will tend to have superior pricing. Nevertheless, the Bureau intends to monitor the construction financing market going forward for signs that circumvention may be occurring and, if so, may take future action regarding the exclusion for the construction phase of construction-to-permanent financing."

In doing so, Congress did not provide any exemptions from HOEPA coverage for any State or other government agencies, either in TILA section 103(bb) or 129. However, until Congress changed the scope of HOEPA's coverage, few if any of their activities were covered.", 
                                "Certain commenters, including an association of State housing finance authorities, urged the Bureau to exempt loans financed by Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs). These commenters observed that HFAs operate as public entities in every State and that, as agencies and instrumentalities of government, they have a unique mission to provide safe and affordable financing. In addition, the commenters stated, loans financed by HFAs tend to perform better than other loans. The commenters stated that many loans financed by HFAs would be unlikely to meet any of HOEPA's coverage tests. On the other hand, according to the commenters, many HFAs offer smaller-loan-amount products that, for example, finance the purchase of manufactured homes in rural areas or support critical repairs and renovations. Because the principal amounts of such loans are so low, the commenters expressed concern that even reasonable fees to offset origination and administrative costs might make many of the loans high-cost mortgages, which in turn could prevent the HFAs from originating the loans. In turn, consumers might turn to financing through costlier forms of credit. The commenters stated that the risk of exempting loans originated under such programs from HOEPA coverage is low because sufficient protections are provided by HFAs' normal lending practices.", 
                                "The Bureau adopts in the final rule an exemption from HOEPA for transactions that are directly financed by an HFA, as that term is defined in 24 CFR 266.5.\n             The Bureau adopts this exemption pursuant to its authority under TILA section 105(a) to exempt all or any class of transactions where necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA, to prevent evasion, or to facilitate compliance. The Bureau believes that this exemption is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA to avoid the uninformed use of credit by ensuring that borrowers seeking to obtain fair and affordable loans originated and financed directly by HFAs are not driven to other, costlier and riskier forms of credit.", 
                                "HFAs are quasi-governmental entities, chartered by either a State or a municipality, that engage in diverse housing financing activities for the promotion of affordable housing. Some HFAs are chartered to promote affordable housing goals across an entire State, while others' jurisdiction extends to only particular cities or counties.\n\n             Among other activities designed to promote affordable homeownership, HFAs provide financial assistance to consumers through first-lien mortgage loans, subordinate-loan financing, and down payment assistance programs (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> a loan to the consumer to assist with the consumer's down payment, or to pay for some of the closing costs). The Bureau understands that HFA lending is characterized by low-cost financing, evaluation of a consumer's repayment ability, and homeownership counseling.\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Bureau understands that, in most cases, HFAs partner with creditors, such as local banks, that extend credit pursuant to the HFA program guidelines. HFAs generally do not provide direct financing to consumers. Nonetheless, the Bureau's exemption of HFAs from HOEPA coverage extends only to those transactions where the HFA itself provides direct financing. Transactions made pursuant to a program administered by an HFA but that are financed by private creditors are still subject to HOEPA coverage. Although the details of HFA programs may differ from State to State, the Bureau believes that consumers in loans where a government-chartered agency is the creditor are sufficiently protected from the types of abuse that HOEPA was designed to address. The Bureau acknowledges that loans financed by private entities in partnership with HFAs may also have significant consumer protections, however the Bureau believes that it is important to retain HOEPA protections for such loans because the HFA does not directly control the transaction."

                        "Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA did not specify how to calculate the APR for purposes of HOEPA's APR coverage test. The Dodd-Frank Act changed this by adding section 103(bb)(1)(B) to TILA. Section 103(bb)(1)(B) instructs creditors to use one of three methods to determine the interest rate for purposes of calculating the APR for high-cost mortgage coverage. The method that the creditor must use depends on whether the transaction is fixed- or variable-rate and, if the transaction is variable-rate, the manner in which the transaction's rate may vary (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> in accordance with an index or otherwise). Under TILA section 103(bb)(1)(B)(i) through (iii), the APR for the high-cost mortgage APR coverage test shall be determined based on the following interest rates, respectively: (1) In the case of a fixed-rate transaction in which the APR will not vary during the term of the loan, the interest rate in effect on the date of consummation of the transaction; (2) in the case of a transaction in which the rate of interest varies solely in accordance with an index, the interest rate determined by adding the index rate in effect on the date of consummation of the transaction to the maximum margin permitted at any time during the loan agreement; and (3) in the case of any other transaction in which the rate may vary at any time during the term of the loan for any reason, the interest charged on the transaction at the maximum rate that may be charged during the term of the loan.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed to implement TILA section 103(bb)(1)(B) in \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2) and related commentary. Specifically, proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(i) would have implemented TILA section 103(bb)(1)(B)(i) concerning fixed-rate transactions; proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(ii) would have implemented TILA section 103(bb)(1)(B)(ii) concerning transactions that vary with an index; and proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(iii) would have implemented TILA section 103(bb)(1)(B)(i) concerning other transactions with rates that vary. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2) above, the Bureau retains existing \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2) in the final rule to provide certain categorical coverage exemptions. Thus, the Bureau adopts proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2) and comments 32(a)(2)-1 and -2 as \u00a7 1026.32(a)(3) and comments 32(a)(3)-1 and -2 in the final rule, with several revisions as discussed below.", 
                        "First, as noted above, TILA section 103(bb)(1)(B) describes how to calculate the APR for the high-cost mortgage APR coverage test. Thus, the statute references the \u201cannual percentage rate of interest.\u201d Proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2) would have implemented TILA section 103(bb)(1)(B) by referencing both the \u201cannual percentage rate\u201d and the \u201ctransaction coverage rate,\u201d as applicable. Proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2) referenced both phrases because, as noted in the section-by-section analysis of proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(1)(i) above, the proposed APR coverage test contained two alternatives that would have required creditors to compare a transaction's APR or transaction coverage rate, respectively, to the average prime offer rate. Because the Bureau is not finalizing the expanded finance charge in connection with its January 2013 rulemakings, the Bureau finalizes \u00a7 1026.32(a)(3) with references only to the APR, rather than to both the APR and the transaction coverage rate.", 
                        "Second, as noted above, TILA section 103(bb)(1)(B) instructs creditors to calculate a transaction's APR based on the interest rate (for a fixed-rate transaction) or index rate (for a transaction that varies with an index) in effect on the date of consummation of the transaction. Proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2) would have referred not only to \u201cconsummation,\u201d but also to \u201caccount opening\u201d to reflect the fact that the requirement also applies to HELOCs. The Bureau received no comments on its inclusion of the phrase \u201caccount opening\u201d and therefore incorporates that phrase into final \u00a7 1026.32(a)(3) as proposed.", 
                        "The Bureau did, however, receive a number of comments stating that the proposal's requirement to use the interest rate or (for variable-rate transactions) the index rate in effect as of consummation or account opening for purposes of calculating the APR for HOEPA coverage would be unworkable as a practical matter. These commenters noted that a creditor may not know until the last minute what index rate to use for purposes of determining HOEPA coverage, and if the index rate changed at the last minute such that the loan became a high-cost mortgage, closing would need to be delayed to comply with the requirement to provide the high-cost mortgage disclosures. The commenters further noted that a different standard\u2014the index rate in effect as of the date the rate for the transaction is set\u2014is used elsewhere in Regulation Z for similar APR determinations, including for determining coverage as a higher-priced mortgage loan under \u00a7 1026.35.", 
                        "Under TILA section 105(a), the Bureau's regulations may contain additional requirements, classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for all or any class of transactions, that the Bureau judges are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance. Pursuant to its authority to make adjustments to facilitate compliance with the TILA, the Bureau adopts in \u00a7 1026.32(a)(3)(i) and (ii), respectively, a requirement that creditors use the interest rate or index rate in effect as of the date the interest rate for the transaction is set (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> the rate-set date), rather than as of consummation as provided in TILA section 103(bb)(1)(B). The Bureau recognizes that, as commenters pointed out, it likely would not be practicable for creditors to wait until consummation or account opening to determine with certainty the applicable interest or index rate to be used for the high-cost mortgage coverage test. Creditors must be able to determine with certainty prior to this time whether a transaction is a high-cost mortgage. The Bureau further acknowledges that other coverage tests under Regulation Z, such as the test for higher-priced mortgage loans under &#167; 1026.35, require creditors to use the rate-set date and believes that it is useful to harmonize the HOEPA APR coverage test with those rules. Thus, providing that the interest or index rate be the rate in effect on the date that the rate for the transaction is set will facilitate compliance, consistent with TILA section 105(a).", 
                        "Proposed comment 32(a)(2)-1 would have made clear that creditors are required to use \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2), rather than existing guidance in comment 17(c)(1)-10.i, to calculate the APR for discounted and premium variable-rate loans. Proposed comment 32(a)(2)-2 would have clarified that the APR for a HELOC must be determined in accordance with \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2), regardless of whether there is an advance of funds at account opening. Proposed comment 32(a)(2)-2 further would have clarified that \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2) does not require HELOC creditors to calculate the APR for any extensions of credit subsequent to account opening. In other words, any draw on the credit line subsequent to account opening is not considered to be a separate open-end \u201ctransaction\u201d for purposes of determining whether the transaction is a high-cost mortgage under the APR coverage test.", 
                        "Proposed comment 32(a)(2)-4 would have clarified the application of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2) for home-equity plans that offer fixed-rate and -term repayment options. As noted in the proposal, some variable-rate HELOC plans may permit borrowers to repay a portion or all of their outstanding balance at a fixed-rate and over a specified period of time. Proposed comment 32(a)(2)-4 would have clarified that, if a HELOC has only a fixed rate during the draw period, the creditor must use that fixed rate to determine the plan's APR, as required by proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(i). If during the draw period, however, a HELOC has a variable rate but also offers a fixed-rate and -term payment option, a creditor must use the terms applicable to the variable-rate feature to determine the plan's APR, as described in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(ii). The Bureau received no comments on proposed comments 32(a)(2)-1, -2, or -4 and finalizes them as proposed, except that the Bureau re-numbers the comments as 32(a)(3)-1, -2, and -5 in the final rule."

                        "Proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(ii) would have implemented TILA section 103(bb)(1)(B)(ii)'s requirements for calculating APRs for transactions in which the interest rate varies solely in accordance with an index. As noted above, pursuant to TILA section 103(bb)(1)(B)(ii), the APR for such transactions must be based on the interest rate that is determined by adding the maximum margin permitted at any time during the loan agreement to the index rate in effect on the date of consummation (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> the fully-indexed rate). Proposed &#167; 1026.32(a)(2)(ii) would have implemented this provision with the additional qualification that it applies only in the case of a transaction in which the interest rate can vary during the term of the loan or plan in accordance with an index outside the creditor's control.", 
                        "The Bureau believed that the proposed qualification would have helped to differentiate TILA section 103(bb)(1)(B)(ii) concerning rates that vary with an index from TILA section 103(bb)(1)(B)(iii) concerning rates that \u201cmay vary at any time during the term of the loan for any reason.\u201d <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> the section-by-section analysis of &#167; 1026.32(a)(3)(iii) below. Specifically, because interest rates for variable-rate HELOCs are prohibited under TILA section 137(a) (as implemented by &#167; 1026.40(f)) from varying pursuant to an index that is within the creditor's control, the Bureau believed that adding the language &#8220;outside the creditor's control&#8221; to proposed &#167; 1026.32(a)(2)(ii) would have clarified that APRs for variable-rate HELOCs should be determined according to &#167; 1026.32(a)(2)(ii) rather than &#167; 1026(a)(2)(iii).", 
                        "Additionally, the Bureau proposed to adopt the clarification pursuant to its authority under TILA 105(a) to prevent circumvention of coverage under HOEPA. The Bureau noted that if the index were in the creditor's control, such as the creditor's own prime lending rate, a creditor might set a low index rate for purposes of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(ii) and thereby avoid classification as a high-cost mortgage. However, subsequent to consummation, the creditor could set a higher index rate, at any time, which would have triggered coverage as a high-cost mortgage under \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(ii) if it were in effect at consummation. Accordingly, the proposal would have provided that, if the interest rate varies in accordance with an index that is under the creditor's control, the creditor would determine the APR under \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(iii), not \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(ii).", 
                        "Proposed comment 32(a)(2)-3 would have provided additional guidance on the application of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(ii) and (iii) to mortgage transactions with interest rates that vary. Specifically, proposed comment 32(a)(2)-3.i would have provided that proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(ii) applies when the interest rate is determined by an index that is outside the creditor's control. In addition, proposed comment 32(a)(2)-3.i would have clarified that even if the transaction has a fixed, discounted introductory or initial interest rate, proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(ii) requires adding the contractual maximum margin to the index, without reflecting the introductory rate. Proposed comment 32(a)(2)-3.i also would have provided that the maximum margin means the highest margin that might apply under the terms of the credit transaction. For example, if the terms of the credit transaction provide that a borrower's margin may increase by 2 percentage points if the borrower's employment with the creditor ends, then the creditor must add that higher margin to the index to determine HOEPA coverage.", 
                        "The Bureau received a number of comments on proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(ii) and (iii). Consumer groups generally advocated that the Bureau depart from the statute by requiring creditors to use the maximum rate permitted under the terms of the mortgage loan or HELOC for all variable-rate transactions. The consumer groups observed that creditors have better information than consumers to predict when interest rates will increase and that, if a consumer could at any time during the term of the loan or credit plan be required to make payments based on an APR within the high-cost mortgage range, the consumer should receive the protections associated with such mortgages.", 
                        "One industry commenter objected to the requirement to recalculate a distinct variable-rate APR solely for purposes of high-cost mortgage coverage, rather than using the composite rate calculation set forth in existing \u00a7 1026.17(c)(1)-10.i. The commenter stated that performing an extra calculation would be extremely burdensome and would introduce additional opportunities for error into the loan origination process.", 
                        "Two industry commenters objected to the requirement that the index be \u201coutside the creditor's control\u201d for purposes of proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(ii), noting that internal indices are used by certain closed-end creditors to price loans to reflect local economic conditions and by, for example, members of the Farm Credit System.", 
                        "Several industry commenters requested clarification about whether rate floors or caps would cause the index to vary in a manner within the creditor's control, such that a creditor originating a loan or credit plan with such features would need to calculate the APR for HOEPA coverage using the maximum rate that could be imposed over the life of the loan under proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(iii). These commenters expressed particular concern about floor rates in HELOCs, noting that most variable-rate HELOCs provide for such a floor rate, even when the rate otherwise varies solely with an index outside the creditor's control. Commenters stated that it would be inappropriate to require HELOC creditors to use the maximum rate applicable over the life of the HELOC under proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(iii) (which often may be the State usury cap) and thereby classify large numbers of HELOCs as high-cost mortgages merely because the credit plan provides for a rate floor.", 
                        "Other industry commenters requested that the Bureau specify that, if a transaction has an introductory rate that is higher than the fully-indexed rate, creditors must use the introductory rate for the APR calculation. Finally, some industry commenters expressed general concern about undue coverage of loans under HOEPA as a result of the requirement in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(iii) to look to the maximum rate for certain variable-rate transactions and general uncertainty about the application of proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2) to HELOCs.", 
                        "The Bureau is renumbering proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(ii) as \u00a7 1026.32(a)(3)(ii), and finalizing follows. First, notwithstanding consumer groups' comments, the Bureau declines to adopt a final rule that would require creditors generally to use the maximum rate applicable during the life of the loan (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> as opposed to the fully-indexed rate) for determining high-cost mortgage coverage. The Bureau understands that creditors originating variable-rate transactions are required to disclose the maximum rate possible during the loan term and that industry practice typically is to disclose the highest rate permissible under State law. The Bureau does not believe that Congress intended all such variable-rate transactions to be classified as high-cost mortgages and believes that the final rule strikes the appropriate balance between the concerns of industry and those of consumer groups.", 
                        "Second, notwithstanding industry's complaints about the burdens of performing an additional calculation, the Bureau implements in the final rule the statutory requirement to calculate APRs for high-cost mortgage coverage pursuant to the requirements set forth in TILA section 103(bb)(1)(B)(ii) and (iii), rather than in accordance with the rules for composite APRs for disclosure purposes under \u00a7 1026.17. The Bureau acknowledges that the final rule may require creditors to conduct an additional calculation to determine high-cost mortgage coverage for variable-rate transactions. However, the Bureau believes that Congress made a deliberate decision to depart from the general APR calculation, to ensure that introductory rates not be given undue weight in determining whether a transaction is a high-cost mortgage. Despite the additional burden associated with a different calculation, the Bureau does not believe that avoidance of an additional calculation is a sufficient basis to use its exception authority to depart from the clear intent of the statute.", 
                        "Third, the Bureau does not adopt in the final rule the proposed requirement that variations in an index must be \u201coutside the creditor's control\u201d for \u00a7 1026.32(a)(3)(ii) to apply. The Bureau is not certain, at present, that the risk of evasion requires adding this limitation. As noted, TILA section 137 and \u00a7 1026.40(f) already prohibit variable-rate HELOCs from employing an index that varies outside the creditor's control. Use of internal indices is also restricted or prohibited for closed-end, variable-rate transactions in many circumstances. Federal regulations significantly restrict the circumstances under which federally-chartered banks and thrifts may use an index within the creditor's control. For example, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations generally require national banks to use an index for ARMs that is \u201creadily available to, and verifiable by, the borrower and beyond the control of the bank.\u201d 12 CFR 34.22(a). Single-family seller/servicer guides published by the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) also indicate that ARMs must be tied to publicly-available indices. Finally, the Alternative Mortgage Transactions Parity Act (AMTPA) provides restrictions on the use of internal indices. AMTPA authorizes state-licensed or -chartered housing creditors to make alternative mortgage transactions such as ARMs in compliance with Federal rather than State law, in order to establish parity and competitive equality between State and Federal lenders. However, AMTPA provides that an ARM cannot benefit from the preemptive effect of Federal law over more restrictive State law unless the transaction uses an index outside the creditor's control or a formula or schedule identifying the amount by which the rate or finance charge can increase and when a change can occur.\n             Finally, based on the public comments received, there appear to be legitimate, if infrequent, circumstances under which creditors use internally-defined indices. Adopting a requirement in this rule that effectively would require all creditors originating variable-rate transactions to use an index outside the creditor's control would cause disruption, for example, to Farm Credit System programs. The Bureau notes, however, that it will continue to monitor whether such a restriction would be sensible as a general matter for closed-end transactions and may revisit the issue in future rulemakings.\n            \n          ", 
                        "Comment 32(a)(3)-3 provides guidance concerning the application of \u00a7 1026.32(a)(3)(ii). Comment 32(a)(3)-3 clarifies that the interest rate for a transaction varies solely in accordance with an index even if the transaction has an introductory rate that is higher or lower than the fully-indexed rate provided that, following the first rate adjustment, the interest rate for the transaction varies solely in accordance with an index. The comment specifies that, for transactions subject to \u00a7 1026.32(a)(3)(ii), the interest rate generally is determined by adding the index rate in effect on the date that the interest rate for the transaction is set to the maximum margin for the transaction, as set forth in the agreement for the loan or plan. However, if a transaction subject to \u00a7 1026.32(a)(3)(ii) has an introductory rate that is higher than the index rate plus the maximum margin for the transaction as of the date the interest rate for the transaction is set, then the interest rate for the APR determination is the higher, initial (or \u201cpremium\u201d) interest rate. \n          ", 
                        "The Bureau agrees with comments received that use of the introductory rate is the appropriate measure under this circumstance and notes that this approach aligns with the definition of \u201cfully-indexed rate\u201d as adopted in the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule. Section 1026.43(c)(5) of that rule implements the payment calculation requirements of TILA section 129C(a), which contains the general requirement that a creditor determine a consumer's ability to repay a mortgage loan. Specifically, \u00a7 1026.43(c)(5) and comment 43(c)(5)(i)-2 of the 2013 ATR Final Rule explain that a creditor must determine a consumer's repayment ability with respect to substantially equal, monthly, fully amortizing payments that are based on the greater of the fully indexed rate or any introductory interest rate.", 
                        "Comment 32(a)(3)-3.iii provides several examples to illustrate the rule. As described in the examples, creditors should use \u00a7 1026.32(a)(3)(ii) notwithstanding the existence of a rate floor or a rate cap on a variable-rate transaction that otherwise varies in accordance with an index. The Bureau believes that the clarification concerning rate floors and rate caps is useful and will promote clarity in applying the rule, notwithstanding the removal of the requirement that the index must be outside the creditor's control for \u00a7 1026.32(a)(3)(ii) to apply. Comment 32(a)(3)-3.iii also notes by way of example that an open-end credit plan may not have a rate that varies other than in accordance with an index, pursuant to existing rules for home-secured open-end credit in \u00a7 1026.40(f)."

Proposed comment 32(a)(2)-3.ii thus would have specified that proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(iii) would apply, for example, to a closed-end credit transaction when interest rate changes are at the creditor's discretion or where multiple fixed rates apply to a transaction, such as a step-rate mortgage, in which specified fixed rates are imposed for specified periods.", 
                        "The Bureau sought comment on its proposals for determining the APR for HOEPA coverage, including on whether any aspect of the proposal could result in unwarranted, over-inclusive HOEPA coverage of HELOCs. In particular, the Bureau noted (as discussed above) that \u00a7 1026.40(f) and its commentary generally prohibit creditors from changing the APR on a HELOC unless the change is based on a publicly-available index outside the creditor's control or unless the rate change is specifically set forth in the agreement, such as step-rate plans. The proposal noted that Regulation Z's HELOC restrictions would effectively limit the application of proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(iii) primarily to certain types of closed-end credit transactions. The Bureau observed that applying proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(iii) to determine the APR for a variable-rate HELOC could result in over-inclusive coverage of HELOCs under HOEPA because the maximum possible interest rate for many variable-rate HELOCs is pegged to the maximum interest rate permissible under State law. That interest rate, in turn, likely would cause the plan's APR to exceed HOEPA's APR threshold. Therefore, the Bureau solicited comment on whether there were any circumstances in which the terms of a variable-rate HELOC might warrant application of proposed \u00a7 1026.32(a)(2)(iii) and, if so, whether additional clarification would be necessary to avoid unwarranted coverage of HELOCs under HOEPA.",

Thus, for example, the 2011 ATR Proposal would have implemented the Dodd-Frank Act's exclusion of certain private mortgage insurance (PMI) premiums from points and fees, as well as added loan originator compensation and prepayment penalties to that definition. The Board proposed to implement those changes in \u00a7 226.32(b)(1) and (2)\n             and to revise and add corresponding commentary.\n            \n          ",

The Bureau believed that issuing separate, different proposals to implement the Dodd-Frank Act's amendments to the definition of points and fees, one for high-cost mortgages and one for qualified mortgages, had the potential to cause compliance burden and uncertainty. The Bureau nevertheless needed to address in the 2012 HOEPA Proposal certain aspects of the points and fees definition, most significantly the interaction of points and fees with the Bureau's proposed more inclusive definition of the finance charge, the application of points and fees to HELOCs, and the correction of certain internal cross-references.", 
                                "To address those issues while also attempting to minimize uncertainty, the Bureau republished in the 2012 HOEPA Proposal the Board's proposed amendments to \u00a7 226.32(b)(1) and (2) substantially as set forth in the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal, with revisions only to address the issues noted above and to conform terminology to existing Regulation Z provisions. The Bureau noted in its 2012 HOEPA Proposal that it was particularly interested in receiving comments concerning any newly-proposed language and the application of the definitions in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1) and (2) to the high-cost mortgage context.",

The comments largely reiterated comments that the Board and the Bureau had received in response to the 2011 ATR Proposal. For example, commenters generally requested greater clarity with respect to whether certain charges (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> charges not known at consummation) must be counted in points and fees.

The exceptions would have been certain mortgage insurance premiums and charges for credit insurance and debt cancellation and suspension coverage. TILA expressly states that those premiums and charges are included in points and fees only if payable at or before closing. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> TILA section 103(bb)(1)(C) (mortgage insurance) and TILA section 103(bb)(4)(D) (credit insurance and debt cancellation and suspension coverage).",

As discussed in the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Board expressed concern in the 2011 ATR Proposal that some fees that occur after closing, such as fees to modify a loan, might be deemed to be points and fees under the new framework. The Board thus requested comment in the 2011 ATR Proposal on whether other fees (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> in addition to certain mortgage insurance premiums and charges for credit insurance and debt cancellation and suspension coverage) should be included in points and fees only if they are &#8220;payable at or before closing.&#8221;", 
                                "As discussed in greater detail in the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule, both industry and consumer group commenters expressed concern (either in response to the 2011 ATR Proposal, the 2012 HOEPA Proposal, or both) that the general requirement to include in points and fees charges \u201cpayable in connection with the transaction\u201d introduced uncertainty into the points and fees calculation by, for example, making it unclear whether certain charges that might not be known (or knowable) as of consummation would need to be included. One industry commenter thus recommended that the Bureau clarify that items included in the finance charge but paid after consummation are carved out of points and fees. One consumer group commenter suggested that the Bureau replace the \u201cpayable in connection with the transaction\u201d phrasing with the general requirement to include in points and fees charges \u201cknown at or before\u201d consummation or account opening. The commenter noted that the \u201cknown at or before\u201d standard would (1) Clarify that charges financed through the loan amount are included in points and fees, (2) prevent creditors from evading the points and fees test by requiring consumers to pay charges after consummation, and (3) enable creditors to calculate the amount of points and fees with certainty at or before consummation.", 
                                "As discussed in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that for the points and fees tests for both high-cost mortgages and qualified mortgages, the charges \u201cpayable in connection with\u201d the transaction are included in points and fees. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> TILA sections 103(bb)(1)(A)(ii) (high-cost mortgages) and 129C(b)(2)(A)(vii) (qualified mortgages). The Bureau appreciates, however, that creditors need certainty in calculating points and fees so they can ensure that they are not exceeding the points and fees thresholds for high-cost mortgages (or that they are not exceeding the points and fees cap for qualified mortgages). The Bureau thus interprets the &#8220;in connection with&#8221; requirement in TILA section 103(bb)(1)(A)(ii) for high-cost mortgages as limiting the universe of charges that need to be included in points and fees.\n             Specifically, to clarify when charges or fees are &#8220;in connection with&#8221; a transaction, the Bureau is specifying in &#167; 1026.32(b)(1) in the 2013 ATR Final Rule that fees or charges are included in points and fees only if they are &#8220;known at or before consummation.&#8221;", 
                                "As discussed in detail in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau also is adding new comment 32(b)(1)-1 to explain when fees or charges are known at or before consummation. The comment explains that charges for a subsequent loan modification generally are not included in points and fees because, at consummation, the creditor would not know whether a consumer would seek to modify the loan and therefore would not know whether charges in connection with a modification would ever be imposed.\n             Comment 32(b)(1)-1 also clarifies that the maximum prepayment penalties that may be charged or collected under the terms of a mortgage loan are known at or before consummation and are included in points and fees under \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(iv), even though the consumer will pay them, if ever, sometime after consummation.\n\n             In addition, comment 32(b)(1)-1 notes that, under \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(C)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) and (iii), certain premiums or other charges for PMI or credit insurance must be included in points and fees only if they are payable at or before consummation. Thus, even if the amounts of such premiums or other charges are known at or before consummation, they are included in points and fees only if they are payable at or before consummation."

This provision (the finance charge prong of points and fees) is implemented in existing \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i). The Dodd-Frank Act did not specifically amend TILA section 103(aa)(4)(A). Nevertheless, both the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal and the Bureau's 2012 HOEPA Proposal proposed several revisions to \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i) and comment 32(b)(1)(i)-1.",

Because \u00a7 1026.4 does not itself require disclosure of the finance charge, the Board proposed to revise this language to read: \u201call items considered to be a finance charge under \u00a7 [1026.4(a)] and [1026.4(b)].\u201d The Board also proposed certain clarifying changes to comment 32(b)(1)(i)-1.", 
                        "In addition to re-publishing the Board's proposed change to \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i), proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i) in the Bureau's 2012 HOEPA Proposal would have amended the finance charge prong of the points and fees definition to ensure that additional charges were not included in points and fees as a result of the more inclusive definition of the finance charge proposed in the Bureau's 2012 TILA-RESPA Integration Proposal. The Bureau believed that the proposed amendment to \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i) was necessary to avoid a potentially unwarranted expansion in HOEPA coverage through an increase in the finance charge.", 
                        "In response both to the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal and to Bureau's 2012 HOEPA Proposal, several industry commenters expressed concern that the proposed definition of points and fees was overbroad because it included all items considered to be a finance charge. The commenters asserted that several items that are included in the finance charge under \u00a7 1026.4(b) are vague or inapplicable in the context of mortgage transactions, or that they duplicate items specifically addressed in other provisions of the points and fees test, thus making the points and fees calculation internally inconsistent. Several industry commenters also requested clarification about whether specific fees and charges are included in points and fees. For example, at least two commenters asked that the Bureau clarify whether (and if so, to what extent) interest, real estate agents' fees, settlement agent costs, hazard insurance premiums, property taxes, \u00a7 1026.4(c)(7) charges, appraisal fees, servicing fees, mortgage insurance premiums, discounts for payment other than by credit, and various optional charges, are included in points and fees. The Bureau responds to these comments below, but generally notes that the finance charge as defined in \u00a7 1026.4 continues to be the starting point for points and fees. Once a creditor has determined whether a charge would be included in points and fees as a finance charge that is known at or before consummation, then a creditor should apply the more specific points and fees provisions in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(A) through (F) to determine whether the charge is excluded. Likewise, even if a creditor has determined that a charge is excluded from points and fees because it is not a finance charge, the creditor must apply the more specific points and fees provisions in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(ii) through (vi) to determine whether the charge nonetheless must be included in points and fees.", 
                        "In response to the 2012 HOEPA Proposal, some industry commenters also generally urged the Bureau to clarify that additional charges would not be brought into points and fees merely by operation of the Bureau's proposed more inclusive definition of the finance charge. Other commenters, particularly consumer groups, expressed dissatisfaction with the Bureau's proposed method for addressing the more inclusive finance charge in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i), generally stating that the Bureau's approach was needlessly complicated and that the Dodd-Frank Act's exclusion of bona fide third-party charges in TILA section 103(bb)(1)(A)(ii) adequately addressed any concerns about unwarranted fees being brought into the points and fees definition through the expanded finance charge.", 
                        "As discussed in part III above, the Bureau will be determining whether to adopt its proposed more inclusive finance charge definition when it finalizes the 2012 TILA-RESPA Integration Proposal, rather than in January 2013. Accordingly, the Bureau neither addresses comments relating to, nor finalizes in this rulemaking, the 2012 HOEPA Proposal's amendment to the definition of points and fees for closed-end credit transactions to address the more Bureau's proposed more inclusive finance charge.", 
                        "The Bureau otherwise is adopting proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i) in the 2013 ATR Final Rule substantially as proposed in the 2011 ATR Proposal and the 2012 HOEPA Proposal, but with certain additions and clarifications in the commentary to \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i) (as well as in other parts of the points and fees calculation) to address commenters' requests for clarification about whether certain fees are included in or excluded from the calculation. These additions and clarifications also are discussed in detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i) in the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule.", 
                        "With respect to certain of the commenters' specific concerns about whether particular items (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> discounts offered to induce payment for a purchase by cash and settlement agent charges), the Bureau notes that creditors should follow &#167; 1026.4 for when such charges must be included in the finance charge. If they are not included in the finance charge, they would not be included in points and fees. Moreover, as discussed below and in new comment 32(b)(1)(i)(D)-1, certain settlement agent charges may also be excluded from points and fees as bona fide third-party charges that are not retained by the creditor, loan originator, or an affiliate of either."

One such item is premiums for government mortgage insurance.\n             Specifically, section 1431 of the Dodd-Frank Act added new TILA section 103(bb)(1)(C), which excludes all government mortgage insurance premiums from the calculation of points and fees. Because such premiums otherwise would be included in points and fees as an item included in the finance charge, the Board in its 2011 ATR Proposal proposed to implement new TILA section 103(bb)(1)(C) in new \u00a7 226.32(b)(1)(i)(B), as an exclusion from the finance charge prong of points and fees.\n            \n          ", 
                        "In implementing the government mortgage insurance premium exclusion provided by new TILA section 103(bb)(1)(C), the Board proposed to exclude from points and fees not only mortgage insurance <em data-original=\"E-03\">premiums</em> under government programs, but also charges for mortgage <em data-original=\"E-03\">guaranties</em> under government programs.\n             The Board stated that it interpreted the statute to exclude such guaranties, and that its proposal was supported by its authority under TILA section 105(a) to make adjustments to facilitate compliance with and effectuate the purposes of TILA. Both the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the USDA expressed concerns to the Board that, if charges for guaranties provided by those agencies and State agencies were included in points and fees, their loans might exceed high-cost mortgage thresholds and the cap for qualified mortgages, thereby disrupting these programs and jeopardizing an important source of credit for many consumers.", 
                        "The Bureau's 2012 HOEPA Proposal would have implemented the exclusion from points and fees of government mortgage insurance premiums and guaranty fees as proposed by the Board in \u00a7 226.32(b)(1)(i)(B) and comment 32(b)(1)(i)-2, with only minor wording changes for consistency with Regulation Z. In excluding guaranty fees, the Bureau, like the Board in its 2011 ATR Proposal, would have exercised its authority under TILA section 105(a) to make adjustments to facilitate compliance with and effectuate the purposes of TILA. For the same reasons stated by the Board in its 2011 ATR Proposal, and as further explained in the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau believes that exercising its authority under TILA section 105(a) to exclude government guaranty fees from points and fees is appropriate to ensure access to credit through Federal and State government programs.", 
                        "The Bureau did not receive any comments in response to its 2012 HOEPA Proposal objecting to the exclusion from points and fees of government mortgage insurance premiums or guaranty fees.\n             The Bureau is adopting these exclusions in the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule substantially as proposed in the 2011 ATR and 2012 HOEPA Proposals, but with clarifying revisions that are discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.(b)(1)(i)(B) in the 2013 ATR Final Rule. For instance, the Bureau is adding an example to comment 32(b)(1)(i)(B)-1 to clarify that mortgage guaranty fees under government programs, such as VA and USDA funding fees, are excluded from points and fees."

                        "As added by the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA section 103(bb)(1)(C) excludes certain PMI premiums from points and fees for high-cost mortgages and qualified mortgages. Specifically, TILA section 103(bb)(1)(C)(ii) provides that points and fees shall exclude any amount of PMI premiums payable at or before consummation that is not in excess of the amount payable under policies in effect at the time of origination under section 203(c)(2)(A) of the National Housing Act, provided that the premium, charge, or fee is required to be refundable on a pro-rated basis and the refund is automatically issued upon notification of the satisfaction of the underlying mortgage loan. TILA section 103(bb)(1)(C)(iii) provides for the exclusion from points and fees of any mortgage insurance premium paid by the consumer after consummation. As with government mortgage insurance premiums and guarantees, because such PMI premiums otherwise would be included in points and fees as an item included in the finance charge, the Board proposed to implement the new exclusion in \u00a7 226.32(b)(1)(i)(B) and comments 32(b)(1)(i)-3 and -4, as an exclusion from the finance charge prong of points and fees.\n            \n          ",

The Bureau's 2012 HOEPA Proposal thus would have excluded from points and fees, as required by amended TILA section 103(bb)(1)(C): (1) All up-front PMI premiums, but only to the extent that such premiums did not exceed government-sponsored premiums and were refundable to the consumer on a pro rata basis, and (2) all PMI premiums payable after consummation.", 
                        "Several industry commenters objected to the 2012 HOEPA Proposal's treatment of PMI premiums for closed-end points and fees. Industry commenters generally voiced the same objections to this provision that they voiced in response to the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal. Specifically, some industry commenters criticized what they viewed as different treatment of PMI and government insurance premiums and argued that PMI premiums should be excluded from points and fees altogether, even if the premiums do not satisfy the statutory standard for exclusion. These commenters stated that PMI provides substantial benefits to consumers and noted that the 2012 HOEPA Proposal was likely to incentivize creditors to originate FHA loans rather than loans requiring PMI if FHA premiums are given more favorable treatment in points and fees. One such commenter stated that driving consumers to FHA loans would be problematic because FHA's insurance book has already grown too large and is at risk of becoming actuarially unsound. Another commenter noted that comparing up-front mortgage insurance premiums for conventional loans to such premiums for FHA loans is problematic for consumers because FHA premiums are structured to have an up-front payment followed by monthly payments, whereas with PMI a consumer can elect to pay a single, up-front premium, to pay on a monthly basis, or to pay through rate. Under the proposal, the commenter argued, consumers would be less likely to be able to choose a single, up-front premium. One commenter argued that tying PMI premiums to up-front government premiums would require conventional lenders to become experts in FHA loans. Some such commenters suggested that all mortgage insurance premiums payable at or before consummation, whether government or private and regardless of amount, should be excluded from points and fees.", 
                        "Other industry commenters objected to the Bureau's proposed implementation of the statutory distinction that would favor refundable PMI premiums over nonrefundable premiums. These commenters noted that nonrefundable premiums tend to be less expensive for consumers than refundable premiums.", 
                        "Finally, some commenters expressed uncertainty as to the precise rule for inclusion of PMI premiums payable at or before consummation in points and fees. It was noted that proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2),</em> as written, could have been interpreted to require inclusion of the entire PMI premium if it exceeded the FHA insurance premium, rather than merely the inclusion of the portion of the premium in excess of the FHA premium. A few commenters also expressed uncertainty about how to complete the FHA premium comparison when originating conventional loans, particularly loans that would not qualify for FHA insurance (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> because their principal balance is too high).", 
                        "These comments on the Bureau's 2012 HOEPA Proposal generally were consistent with concerns raised in response to the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal. Thus, commenters' concerns primarily are addressed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(C) in the 2013 ATR Final Rule. As discussed in greater detail therein, the Bureau is finalizing proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(B) concerning PMI premiums in the 2013 ATR Final Rule substantially as proposed in the 2011 ATR and 2012 HOEPA Proposals. However, the Bureau finalizes the provision in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(C) and divides it into two parts. The first part, \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(C)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>), addresses PMI premiums payable at or before consummation. The second part, &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(C)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>), addresses PMI premiums payable after consummation.", 
                        "As noted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, with respect to the comments requesting that all PMI premiums be excluded from points and fees, the Bureau notes that Congress enacted TILA section 103(bb)(1)(C), which created different treatment of government and PMI premiums and prescribed specific and detailed conditions for excluding PMI premiums (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> based on the amount of the premium and whether it is refundable). The Bureau does not believe it would be appropriate to exercise its exception authority to reverse Congress's decision.", 
                        "The Bureau acknowledges, however, that there is a need for clarification as to what portion of any PMI premium payable at or before consummation must be included in points and fees. Thus, as discussed more fully in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau adopts in that rulemaking clarifying changes that, among other things, specify that only the portion of a PMI premium payable at or before consummation that exceeds the government premium is included in points and fees. The Bureau also adopts clarifying changes that specify that creditors originating conventional loans\u2014even such loans that are not eligible to be FHA loans (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> because their principal balance is too high)&#8212;should look to the permissible up-front premium amount for FHA loans, as implemented by applicable regulations and other written authorities issued by the FHA (such as Mortgagee Letters). For example, pursuant to HUD's Mortgagee Letter 12-4 (published March 6, 2012), the allowable up-front FHA premium for single-family homes is 1.75 percent of the base loan amount.\n\n             Finally, the Bureau clarifies that only the portion of the single or up-front PMI premium in excess of the allowable FHA premium (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> rather than any monthly premium or portion thereof) must be included in points and fees."

This bona fide third-party charge exclusion from points and fees for high-cost mortgages is identical to the exclusion of such charges from points and fees for qualified mortgages under TILA section 129C(b)(2)(C), which the Board proposed to implement in its 2011 ATR Proposal in \u00a7 226.43(e)(3)(ii)(A).\n             Such a bona fide third-party charge would include, for example, a counseling fee paid by the consumer to a HUD-certified homeownership counseling organization to receive the counseling required for high-cost mortgages under \u00a7 1026.34(a)(5).\n             For consistency and to ease compliance, the Bureau proposed in its 2012 HOEPA Proposal to implement the bona fide third-party charge exclusion for high-cost mortgages in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5)(i) in a manner that mirrored in all significant respects the Board's proposed \u00a7 226.43(e)(3)(ii)(A) concerning such charges.\n            \n          ",

As just discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(C), the Dodd-Frank Act amended TILA to add section 103(bb)(1)(C)(ii), which excludes only certain PMI premiums from the points and fees calculation for high-cost mortgages. Thus, the Bureau would have implemented TILA's general exclusion of bona fide third-party charges from the points and fees calculation for high-cost mortgages in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5)(i) with the caveat that certain PMI premiums must be included in points and fees for closed-end credit transactions as set forth in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(B).\n             In other words, where one portion of the statutory points and fees provision would exclude the charge (the general provision) and another would include it (the specific provision), the Bureau interpreted TILA to require the charge to be included in the calculation.",

Proposed comment 32(b)(5)(i)-2 would have provided an example for purposes of determining whether a charge may be excluded from points and fees as a bona fide third-party charge. Proposed comment 32(b)(5)(i)-3 addressing PMI premiums mirrored proposed comment 43(e)(3)(ii)-2 in the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal, except that proposed comment 32(b)(5)(i)-3 would have provided that it applies for purposes of determining whether a mortgage is a high-cost mortgage, rather than a qualified mortgage. Proposed comment 32(b)(5)(i)-3 also would have specified that the comment applies to closed-end transactions.", 
                        "The Bureau received two main categories of comments concerning proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5)(i). First, several industry commenters stated that Congress intended the \u201cbona fide third-party charge\u201d exclusion to establish a \u201cbona fide\u201d standard, rather than a \u201creasonable\u201d standard, for the exclusion of all third-party charges from points and fees for high-cost mortgages (and qualified mortgages). These comments are addressed below in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(iii), which deals with the inclusion in points and fees of certain real estate-related charges paid to the creditor or an affiliate of the creditor.\n            \n          ", 
                        "Second, GSE commenters argued, as they did in comments submitted in response to the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal, that loan-level price adjustments (LLPAs) should be excluded from points and fees for high-cost mortgages as bona fide third-party charges. LLPAs are made by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when purchasing loans to offset perceived risks, such as a high loan-to-value ratio (LTV) or low credit score, among many other risk factors. The Board's 2011 ATR Proposal solicited comment on whether such charges, including charges in connection with similar risk-based price adjustments for mortgages held in portfolio, should be excluded from points and fees for qualified mortgages. As discussed in detail in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, creditors may, but are not required to, increase the interest rate charged to the consumer so as to offset the impact of the LLPAs or increase the costs to the consumer in the form of points to offset the lost revenue resulting from the LLPAs. GSE commenters thus argued that these points should not be counted in points and fees for high-cost mortgages (or for qualified mortgages) under the exclusion for \u201cbona fide third party charges not retained by the loan originator, creditor, or an affiliate of either\u201d in TILA section 103(bb)(1)(A)(ii) (or TILA section 129C(b)(2)(C)(i) for qualified mortgages). The GSE commenters noted that LLPAs did not exist when \u00a7 1026.32 was originally adopted, so there has been no guidance on whether such charges should be included in, or excluded from, points and fees. The commenters stated that the lack of guidance is now an issue because of the revised points and fees definition and lower threshold for points and fees for high-cost mortgages following the Dodd-Frank Act.", 
                        "The GSE commenters, as well as certain industry commenters, worried that, without an exclusion for LLPAs, points and fees would quickly be consumed by these fees and loan originator compensation, such that loans could have trouble staying under the general 5 percent high-cost mortgage points and fees threshold. The GSE commenters stated that LLPAs meet the definition of a bona fide third-party charge as that term was proposed in the 2011 ATR and 2012 HOEPA Proposals, because the creditor does not retain the charge. In addition, LLPAs are set fees that are transparent and accessible via the GSEs' Web sites, so there is little risk of abuse. The commenters acknowledged that some creditors charge similar risk-based price adjustments to consumers even when holding loans in portfolio, but they argued that such risk-based price adjustments also could be excluded from points and fees if they were made publicly available, as the GSE's charges are, or disclosed to consumers as a third-party fee on the Bureau's proposed TILA-RESPA integrated disclosure form. Certain industry comments suggested that the Bureau clarify that LLPAs may be excluded from points and fees as bona fide discount points. Consumer groups did not comment on this issue. \n          ", 
                        "To ensure a streamlined definition of points and fees in the high-cost mortgage and qualified mortgage contexts, the Bureau is adopting proposed \u00a7 226.43(e)(3)(ii)(A) (from the 2011 ATR Proposal) and proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5)(i) as applied to closed-end credit transactions (from the 2012 HOEPA Proposal) in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D) in the 2013 ATR Final Rule.\n             The Bureau believes that this placement is sensible in the context of both rulemakings given that the items excluded through the bona fide third-party charge exclusion would be counted in points and fees, if at all, as a finance charge.", 
                        "Section 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D) as adopted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule retains the proposed caveat that the exclusion of bona fide third-party charges from points and fees is subject to the limitation that certain amounts of PMI premiums must sometimes be included in the calculation pursuant to \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(C). In addition, the 2013 ATR Final Rule adopts \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D) with two new comments reflecting that the exclusion for bona fide third-party charges also is subject to the more specific points and fees provisions in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(iii) and (iv). As adopted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D) thus provides that a bona fide third-party charge not retained by the creditor, loan originator, or an affiliate of either is excluded from points and fees unless the charge is required to be included under \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(C) (PMI premiums), (iii) (certain real estate-related fees), or (iv) (credit insurance premiums). The final rule thus adheres to the approach that the specific statutory provisions regarding PMI (TILA section 103(bb)(1)(C)), certain real estate-related fees (TILA section 103(bb)(4)(C)), and credit insurance premiums (TILA section 103(bb)(4)(D)) should govern whether these charges are included in points and fees, rather than the more general provisions regarding the exclusion of bona fide third-party charges in TILA sections 103(bb)(1)(A)(ii) and 129C(b)(2)(C) for high-cost mortgages and qualified mortgages, respectively.", 
                        "As discussed in detail in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau acknowledges that TILA sections 103(bb)(1)(A)(ii) and 129C(b)(2)(C) concerning bona fide third-party charges could be read to provide for a two-step calculation of points and fees. First, the creditor would calculate points and fees as defined in TILA section 103(bb)(4). Second, the creditor would exclude all bona fide third-party charges not retained by the mortgage originator, creditor, or an affiliate of either, as provided in TILA sections 103(bb)(1)(A)(ii) and 129C(b)(2)(C). Under this reading, certain charges\u2014such as for private mortgage insurance premiums\u2014could initially, in step one, be included in points and fees. In step two, these charges would be excluded if they were bona fide third-party charges.", 
                        "However, to give meaning to the specific statutory provisions regarding mortgage insurance, real estate related fees, and credit insurance, the Bureau believes that the better reading is that these specific provisions should govern whether such charges are included in points and fees, rather than the general provisions excluding certain bona fide third-party charges. In support of this approach, the Bureau also invokes its authority under TILA section 105(a) to make such adjustments and exceptions as are necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA. The Bureau believes that Congress included specific provisions regarding these types of fees in part to deter the imposition of excessive fees. Allowing exclusion of these fees and charges if they are \u201cbona fide\u201d\u2014without meeting any of the other conditions specified by Congress\u2014would undermine this purpose. Additionally, it would in effect nullify the specific conditions Congress set forth for exclusion from the points and fees calculation.", 
                        "As noted above, GSE commenters argued that points charged by creditors to offset LLPAs should be excluded from points and fees as bona fide third-party charges. In setting the purchase price for loans, the GSEs impose LLPAs to offset certain credit risks, and creditors may\u2014but are not required to\u2014recoup the revenue lost as a result of the LLPAs by increasing the costs to consumers in the form of points. As noted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau believes that the manner in which creditors respond to LLPAs is better viewed as a fundamental component of how the pricing of a mortgage loan is determined, rather than as a third-party charge. As the Board noted in its 2011 ATR Proposal, allowing creditors to exclude points charged to offset LLPAs could create market imbalances between loans sold on the secondary market and loans held in portfolio. While such imbalances could be addressed by excluding risk adjustment fees more broadly, including such fees charged by creditors for loans held in portfolio, the Bureau agrees with the Board that this could create compliance and enforcement difficulties. Thus, the Bureau concludes that, if points are charged to offset LLPAs, those points may not be excluded from points and fees as bona fide third-party charges. However, to the extent that creditors offer consumers the opportunity to pay points to lower the interest rate that the creditor would otherwise charge to recover the lost revenue from the LLPAs, such points may be excluded from points and fees as bona fide discount points if they satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(E) or (F).", 
                        "In light of the foregoing considerations, the Bureau is finalizing the exclusion of bona fide third-party charges from closed-end points and fees in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D) in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, with comments 32(b)(1)(i)(D)-1 through -4 providing further guidance concerning the interaction of the bona fide third-party charge exclusion with other points and fees provisions. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> comments 32(b)(1)(i)(D)-1 (third-party settlement agent charges), -2 (PMI premiums), -3 (real estate-related charges), and -4 (credit insurance premiums)."

                                "Section 1431(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act added new section 103(dd)(1) to TILA, which permits a creditor to exclude from points and fees for high-cost mortgages up to and including two bona fide discount points payable by the consumer in connection with the mortgage, but only if the interest rate from which the mortgage's interest rate will be discounted does not exceed by more than one percentage point (1) the average prime offer rate or (2) for loans secured by personal property, the average rate on a loan for which insurance is provided under Title I of the National Housing Act.\n             New TILA section 103(dd)(1) for high-cost mortgages is substantially similar to new TILA section 129C(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I).

                                "In the 2012 HOEPA Proposal, the Bureau proposed to implement the exclusion of up to two bona fide discount points from points and fees for high-cost mortgages in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5)(ii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) (loans secured by real property) and (<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>) (loans secured by personal property).\n\n             The proposed provision generally would have been consistent with proposed &#167; 226.43(e)(3)(ii)(B) in the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal, which would have implemented new TILA section 129C(b)(2)(C)(ii)(I) for qualified mortgages. Specifically, proposed &#167; 1026.32(b)(5)(ii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) would have permitted a creditor to exclude from points and fees for high-cost mortgages up to two bona fide discount points payable by the consumer, provided that the interest rate for the closed- or open-end credit transaction without such discount points would not exceed by more than one percentage point the average prime offer rate as defined in &#167; 1026.35(a)(2). Proposed &#167; 1026.32(b)(5)(ii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>) would have implemented the special calculation for determining whether up to two discount points could be excluded from the high-cost mortgage points and fees calculation for transactions secured by personal property. Thus, under proposed &#167; 1026.32(b)(5)(ii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>) a creditor extending credit secured by personal property could exclude from points and fees up to two bona fide discount points payable by the consumer, provided that the interest rate for the closed- or open-end credit transaction without such discount points would not exceed by more than one percentage point the average rate on loans insured under Title I of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1702 <em data-original=\"E-03\">et seq.</em>).", 
                                "Proposed comment 32(b)(5)(ii)-1 would have clarified how to determine, for purposes of the bona fide discount point exclusion in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5)(ii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) and (B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>), whether a transaction's interest rate met the requirement not to exceed the average prime offer rate by more than one or two percentage points, respectively. Specifically, proposed comment 32(b)(5)(ii)-1 would have provided that the average prime offer rate for proposed &#167; 1026.32(b)(5)(ii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) and (B)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) is the average prime offer rate that applies to a comparable transaction as of the date the interest rate for the transaction is set. Proposed comment 32(b)(5)(ii)-1 would have cross-referenced proposed comments 32(a)(1)(i)-1 and -2 for closed- and open-end credit transactions, respectively, for guidance as to determining the applicable average prime offer rate.

                                "The Bureau received several comments concerning the exclusion of discount points from points and fees for high-cost mortgages. The comments, which were from industry, generally requested that the Bureau use its authority to eliminate or loosen the requirement that the interest rate prior to the discount not exceed the average prime offer rate by the statutorily-prescribed amount. The commenters stated that the starting interest rate requirement is too restrictive and will mean that, in many cases, creditors will not be able to deduct any discount points from points and fees. Thus, for example, one commenter suggested that one percentage point be added to the margin above the average prime offer rate for jumbo loans and loans on second homes, which tend to have higher interest rates. A few industry commenters also requested that the Bureau clarify that discount points that meet the criteria are excluded from points and fees regardless of who pays them (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> the consumer, the seller, or another person, such as the consumer's employer).\n             The Bureau did not receive any comments specifically on proposed comment 32(b)(5)(ii)-1; however, one industry commenter requested that the Bureau clarify whether the examples in proposed comments 43(e)(3)(ii)-3 and -4 in the 2011 ATR Proposal for performing the discount point calculation apply in the high-cost mortgage context.", 
                                "As noted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, which received similar comments concerning the exclusion of bona fide discount points from the points and fees calculation for qualified mortgages, the starting interest rate limitations are prescribed in the statute. The Bureau recognizes that these limitations may circumscribe the ability of consumers to purchase more discount points to lower their interest rates. Nevertheless, Congress apparently concluded that there was a greater probability of consumer injury when consumers purchased more than two discount points or when consumers use discount points to buy down interest rates that exceed the average prime offer rate by more than two percentage points. In the absence of data or specific information suggesting a contrary conclusion, the Bureau declines to use its authority to adjust the statutory requirement.", 
                                "As to comments seeking guidance that discount points may be excluded if not directly paid by the consumer, the Bureau notes that creditors should continue to apply the basic rules of Regulation Z concerning whether points are included in the finance charge and, in turn, whether they are included in points and fees. For example, because seller's points are excluded from the finance charge under existing \u00a7 1026.4(c)(5), they are not included in points and fees, regardless of whether they meet the bona fide discount point test for exclusion.", 
                                "In light of the foregoing considerations, the Bureau adopts in the 2013 ATR Final Rule the exclusion from points and fees of up to two bona fide discount points substantially as proposed in the 2011 ATR and 2012 HOEPA Proposals (for qualified mortgages and high-cost mortgages, respectively). However, to ensure a streamlined definition of points and fees in the high-cost mortgage and qualified mortgage contexts, the Bureau is finalizing proposed \u00a7 226.43(e)(3)(ii)(B) (from the 2011 ATR Proposal) and proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5)(ii)(A)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) and (<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>) as applied to closed-end credit transactions (from the 2012 HOEPA Proposal) in &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(E) in the 2013 ATR Final Rule. Section 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(E)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">1</em>) sets forth the general rule, and &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(E)(<em data-original=\"E-03\">2</em>) sets forth the special rule under HOEPA for personal property-secured loans. The Bureau believes that this placement is sensible in the context of both rulemakings given that the points excluded through the bona fide discount point exclusion would be counted in points and fees, if at all, through the finance charge prong.", 
                                "The 2013 ATR Final Rule finalizes proposed comment 32(b)(5)(ii)-1 from the 2012 HOEPA Proposal as comment 32(b)(1)(i)(E)-2, with certain non-substantive changes. The 2013 ATR Final Rule also adopts as comment 32(b)(1)(i)(E)-1 a cross-reference to \u00a7 1026.32(b)(3) for the definition of \u201cbona fide discount point,\u201d and as comment 32(b)(1)(i)(E)-3 examples of how to calculate the exclusion of up to two bona fide discount points from points and fees. These comments are discussed in further detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(E) in the 2013 ATR Final Rule. The Bureau notes that finalizing the bona fide discount point exclusion for both qualified mortgages and high-cost mortgages in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1) should streamline compliance and alleviate any concern that the rules would be applied differently in the high-cost and qualified mortgage contexts."

                        "When HOEPA was enacted in 1994, it required that \u201call compensation paid to mortgage brokers\u201d be counted toward the threshold for points and fees that triggers special consumer protections under the statute. Specifically, TILA section 103(aa)(4) provided that charges are included in points and fees only if they are payable at or before consummation and did not expressly address whether \u201cbackend\u201d payments from creditors to mortgage brokers funded out of the interest rate (commonly referred to as yield spread premiums) are included in points and fees.\n             This requirement is implemented in existing \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(ii), which requires that all compensation paid by consumers directly to mortgage brokers be included in points and fees, but does not address compensation paid by creditors to mortgage brokers or compensation paid by any company to individual employees (such as loan officers who are employed by a creditor or mortgage broker).", 
                        "The Dodd-Frank Act substantially expanded the scope of compensation included in points and fees for both the high-cost mortgage threshold in HOEPA and the qualified mortgage points and fees limits. Section 1431 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended TILA to require that \u201call compensation paid <em data-original=\"E-03\">directly or indirectly</em> by a consumer <em data-original=\"E-03\">or creditor</em> to a mortgage originator from any source, including a mortgage originator that is also the creditor in a table-funded transaction,&#8221; be included in points and fees. TILA section 103(bb)(4)(B) (emphasis added). Under amended TILA section 103(bb)(4)(B), compensation paid to anyone that qualifies as a &#8220;mortgage originator&#8221; is to be included in points and fees.\n             Thus, in addition to compensation paid to mortgage brokerage firms and individual brokers, points and fees also includes compensation paid to other mortgage originators, including employees of a creditor (i.e., loan officers). In addition, as noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act removed the phrase &#8220;payable at or before closing&#8221; from the high-cost mortgage points and fees test and did not apply the &#8220;payable at or before closing&#8221; limitation to the points and fees cap for qualified mortgages. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> TILA sections 103(bb)(1)(A)(ii) and 129C(b)(2)(A)(vii), (b)(2)(C). Thus, the statute appears to contemplate that even compensation paid to mortgage brokers and other loan originators after consummation should be counted toward the points and fees thresholds.", 
                        "This change is one of several provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that focus on loan originator compensation and regulation, in apparent response to concerns that industry compensation practices contributed to the mortgage market crisis by creating strong incentives for brokers and retail loan officers to steer consumers into higher-priced loans. Specifically, loan originators were often paid a commission by creditors that increased with the interest rate on a transaction. These commissions were funded by creditors through the increased revenue received by the creditor as a result of the higher rate paid by the consumer and were closely tied to the price the creditor expected to receive for the loan on the secondary market as a result of that higher rate.\n             In addition, many mortgage brokers charged consumers up-front fees to cover some of their costs at the same time that they accepted backend payments from creditors out of the rate. This may have contributed to consumer confusion about where the brokers' loyalties lay.", 
                        "The Dodd-Frank Act took a number of steps to address loan originator compensation issues, including: (1) Adopting requirements that loan originators be \u201cqualified\u201d as defined by Bureau regulations; (2) generally prohibiting compensation based on rate and other terms (except for loan amount) and prohibiting a loan originator from receiving compensation from both consumers <em data-original=\"E-03\">and</em> other parties in a single transaction; (3) requiring the promulgation of additional rules to prohibit steering consumers to less advantageous transactions; (4) requiring the disclosure of loan originator compensation; and (5) restricting loan originator compensation under HOEPA and the qualified mortgage provisions by including such compensation within the points and fees calculations. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> TILA sections 103(bb)(4)(A)(ii), (B); 128(a)(18); 129B(b), (c); 129C(b)(2)(A)(vii), (C)(i).", 
                        "The Board's 2011 ATR Proposal proposed revisions to \u00a7 226.32(b)(1)(ii) to implement the inclusion of more forms of loan originator compensation into the points and fees thresholds. Those proposed revisions tracked the statutory language, with two exceptions. First, the Board's proposed \u00a7 226.32(b)(1)(ii) did not include the phrase \u201cfrom any source.\u201d The Board noted that the statute covers compensation paid \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d to the loan originator, and concluded that it would be redundant to cover compensation \u201cfrom any source.\u201d Second, for consistency with Regulation Z, the proposal used the term \u201cloan originator\u201d as defined in \u00a7 226.36(a)(1), rather than the term \u201cmortgage originator\u201d that appears in section 1401 of the Dodd-Frank Act. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> TILA section 103(cc)(2). The Board explained that it interpreted the definitions of mortgage originator under the statute and loan originator under existing Regulation Z to be generally consistent, with one exception that the Board concluded was not relevant for purposes of the points and fees thresholds. Specifically, the statutory definition refers to &#8220;any person who represents to the public, through advertising or other means of communicating or providing information (including the use of business cards, stationery, brochures, signs, rate lists, or other promotional items), that such person can or will provide&#8221; the services listed in the definition (such as offering or negotiating loan terms), while the existing Regulation Z definition does not include persons solely on this basis. The Board concluded that it was not necessary to add this element of the definition to implement the points and fees calculations anyway, reasoning that the calculation of points and fees is concerned only with loan originators that receive compensation for performing defined origination functions in connection with a consummated loan. The Board noted that a person who merely represents to the public that such person can offer or negotiate mortgage terms for a consumer has not yet received compensation for that function, so there is no compensation to include in the calculation of points and fees for a particular transaction.", 
                        "In the proposed commentary, the Board explained what compensation would and would not have been included in points and fees under proposed \u00a7 226.32(b)(1)(ii). The Board proposed to revise existing comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-1 to clarify that compensation paid by either a consumer or a creditor to a loan originator, as defined in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1), would be included in points and fees. Proposed comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-1 also stated that loan originator compensation already included in points and fees because it is included in the finance charge under \u00a7 226.32(b)(1)(i) would not be counted again under \u00a7 226.32(b)(1)(ii).", 
                        "Proposed comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-2.i stated that, in determining points and fees, loan originator compensation includes the dollar value of compensation paid to a loan originator for a specific transaction, such as a bonus, commission, yield spread premium, award of merchandise, services, trips, or similar prizes, or hourly pay for the actual number of hours worked on a particular transaction. Proposed comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-2.ii clarified that loan originator compensation excludes compensation that cannot be attributed to a transaction at the time of origination, including, for example, the base salary of a loan originator that is also the employee of the creditor, or compensation based on the performance of the loan originator's loans or on the overall quality of a loan originator's loan files. Proposed comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-2.i also explained that compensation paid to a loan originator for a covered transaction must be included in the points and fees calculation for that transaction whenever paid, whether at or before closing or any time after closing, as long as the compensation amount can be determined at the time of closing. In addition, proposed comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-2.i provided three examples of compensation paid to a loan originator that would have been included in the points and fees calculation.", 
                        "Proposed comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-3 stated that loan originator compensation includes amounts the loan originator retains and is not dependent on the label or name of any fee imposed in connection with the transaction. Proposed comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-3 offered an example of a loan originator imposing and retaining a \u201cprocessing fee\u201d and stated that such a fee is loan originator compensation, regardless of whether the loan originator expends the fee to process the consumer's application or uses it for other expenses, such as overhead.", 
                        "The Bureau's 2012 HOEPA Proposal largely republished the proposed revisions and additions to proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(ii) and related commentary in contained in the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal, with only non-substantive edits that, for example, clarified that the provisions would have applied to any closed-end credit transactions subject to \u00a7 1026.32.", 
                        "The Bureau received a large number of comments on proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(ii) and its related commentary in response to the 2012 HOEPA Proposal. Most of the comments came from industry groups or individual institutions. As with other aspects of the definition of points and fees, industry commenters' concerns regarding this provision were similar to those that were raised in response to the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal, which are addressed in detail in the preamble of the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule. Industry commenters objected to the proposed inclusion of loan originator compensation in the points and fees calculation for high-cost mortgages for the following main reasons.", 
                        "Many industry commenters objected to the general requirement to include loan originator compensation in points and fees. Some of these commenters suggested that the Bureau should use its exception authority to exclude loan originator compensation from the calculation. Several commenters argued that consumers are already protected from harmful compensation practices by other Dodd-Frank Act rules, such as those proposed to be implemented in the Bureau's 2012 Loan Originator Proposal. Some such commenters asserted that the HOEPA proposal, by requiring permissible compensation to be counted toward HOEPA points and fees coverage, would undercut the value derived from the payments deemed proper under the Bureau's other rules. In addition, the commenters argued, including loan originator compensation in points and fees would constrain credit and harm consumers by, for example, increasing the number of loans that might exceed the HOEPA points and fees threshold.", 
                        "A number of industry commenters asserted, in particular, that loan originator compensation paid to individual employees should not be counted in points and fees. Some commenters stated that the proposed inclusion of loan originator compensation to employees is contrary to the intent of the statute, which the commenters argued was merely intended to cover business entities and not individuals. Other commenters stated, for example, that employee compensation is not a direct cost to the consumer and that it is indistinguishable from aspects of a company's overall cost and expenditure structure, such expenses for rent, marketing, or office supplies, which are not counted in points and fees.", 
                        "A number of commenters noted that including compensation to individual loan originators in points and fees would constitute double-counting of costs, because loan originator compensation already is included in the cost of the loan, as an overhead charge. The commenters requested that the Bureau clarify, for example, that compensation paid by a lender to its own loan originator, which is not paid directly by the borrower but rather from the lender's profits or post-closing sale of the loan, should not be counted in points and fees. Similarly, at least one commenter requested that the Bureau clarify that lenders can assume that a fee paid to a broker includes any compensation paid to the broker's employees, and that the lender should have no responsibility to separately account for such payments. One commenter argued that, if compensation to mortgage broker employees is excluded, then compensation to retail loan officer employees should be excluded as well.", 
                        "Some industry commenters asserted that including loan originator compensation in points and fees is not only unnecessary in light of other Bureau rulemakings, but also that including it would lead to anomalous results, because otherwise identical loans may have different points and fees depending on which loan officer originates a loan (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> because better or more experienced loan originators tend to earn more compensation) or on when in the year a loan is originated (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> because compensation tends to increase throughout the year as periodic, volume-based bonus thresholds are met). Neither of these factors is indicative of the terms of the loan itself, but consumers' access to credit could depends on such factors, because creditors likely would choose not to originate a loan if its associated loan originator compensation would cause its points and fees to exceed the HOEPA threshold. Commenters stated that the effects of such anomalous results could be felt within one company (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> as between an experienced and a more junior loan officer), or between companies (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> with one company that compensates its loan officers more than another company).", 
                        "Industry commenters also asserted that developing company-wide systems to track employee compensation on a loan-by-loan basis would be highly burdensome, with little consumer benefit. The system changes that would be required would be complex, because there are so many variations in how compensation may be paid. Creditors would continue to face practical challenges even after such systems were established. Many compensation plans pay bonuses at the end of the month, period, or year, so determining compensation to be included at origination would be difficult. One result, commenters asserted, would be that the amount of compensation included in points and fees could be easily second-guessed after the fact, which could be highly problematic (particularly for assignees) considering the risk of liability attendant to originating or purchasing a high-cost mortgage. For example, commenters asserted that such second-guessing could increase the risk that a loan might be determined to be a high-cost mortgage, even if it was not clear to the creditor at origination that it was a high-cost mortgage. Finally, some commenters noted that a rule requiring accurate determination of compensation at origination would require wholesale changes in compensation practices, which is more appropriately addressed in other rulemakings.", 
                        "Not only would tracking compensation be burdensome, but commenters requested additional guidance concerning when particular types of compensation would be required to be included in the calculation. For example, several commenters stated that compensation often is tied to conditions, such as continued employment, that are not known as of consummation. Other conditions to which compensation might be tied include, for example, the customer service rating of the loan originator, or overall company performance for a particular period of time. Some commenters similarly noted that it was unclear how to count compensation awarded in tiered compensation plans where, for example, the amount of compensation increases as the loan originator's total aggregate volume increases. In such plans, commenters stated, the compensation tier cannot be determined until month- or quarter-end, and the rule as proposed is not clear about whether such compensation would need to be counted.", 
                        "Several commenters suggested that, if the Bureau were to adopt a rule including individual loan originator compensation in points and fees, then the Bureau should clearly exclude certain types of compensation, such as salary and hourly wages, from the calculation. The commenters asserted that these types of compensation generally are not tied to any specific loan transaction. The commenters stated that it would be difficult to determine how much of such compensation to count in the points and fees calculation before or at consummation, that establishing systems to make such a determination would be costly, and that including hourly wages would create an incentive for loan originators to spend less time on loans, to the detriment of consumers and in contrast to the overall goal of ensuring, for example, careful loan underwriting.", 
                        "A number of commenters requested additional guidance concerning the timing of the loan originator compensation calculation. The commenters stated that it would be impracticable to require compensation to be counted as of consummation. In this regard, several commenters asked whether compensation should be determined based on facts known at some earlier time, such as the rate-lock date.", 
                        "Some commenters also emphasized the importance of having clear guidance concerning the amount of loan originator compensation to be included in points and fees. The commenters stated that ambiguous rules would make it difficult to know how much compensation to count for a particular transaction and, in turn, difficult to discern whether a transaction exceeds the HOEPA points and fees threshold. A few commenters noted that this is of particular concern for entities looking to purchase loans, or for entities conducting due diligence reviews prior to purchase, since it is necessary to determine if points and fees are accurate, to avoid purchasing a high-cost mortgage.", 
                        "Finally, a number of industry commenters urged the Bureau to provide additional guidance concerning who would be considered a loan originator for purposes of the points and fees test. Several commenters objected to the fact that the Bureau seemingly had not coordinated its proposed definitions of \u201cloan originator\u201d across its various title XIV rulemakings, or with the definition of that term as set forth in the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008. The commenters noted that the Bureau's 2012 Loan Originator Proposal would have adopted a broad definition of loan originator. According to these commenters, a broad definition will be difficult to apply in the points and fees context, as it will require tracking compensation of anyone who, for compensation, takes an application, arranges, offers, negotiates, or otherwise obtains an extension of consumer credit for another person.", 
                        "Manufactured housing industry commenters expressed a related concern about the definition of loan originator as applied to employees of manufactured home retailers. Under TILA's definition of loan originator, an \u201cactivities-based\u201d test would apply in determining whether such a person was a loan originator. Thus, creditors would need to track the activities of manufactured home retailer employees to determine whether to count their compensation in points and fees. Commenters asserted that a manufactured home retailer has no way of knowing, or controlling, such activities for a given transaction. At least one commenter argued for a bright-line exclusion from loan originator compensation for any manufactured home retailer or its employees. Other commenters argued for replacing the activities-based exclusion with a bright-line test, such as an exclusion for retailer (or retailer employee) compensation that does not exceed what the retailer or its employee would have received in a comparable cash transaction.", 
                        "Consumer group commenters strongly supported the inclusion of loan originator compensation in points and fees. The commenters noted that outsized mortgage broker compensation was one of the primary drivers of the passage of HOEPA in the mid-1990's. The commenters also noted that compensation schemes involving yield spread premiums later became another vehicle through which consumers were assessed costs they were wholly unaware existed, and that the Dodd-Frank Act sought to put such abuses to rest.\n            \n          ", 
                        "Some consumer group commenters strongly opposed the Bureau's proposal to apply, in the points and fees context, TILA's activities-based test for determining whether an employee of a manufactured home retailer is a loan originator whose compensation must be counted. These commenters asserted that a test that attempts to distinguish between employees who, for example, take an application or advise on loan terms (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> loan originators), from employees who merely assist a consumer in obtaining or applying for a loan (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> not loan originators) would be unworkable. Commenters either argued that the activities listed in the activities-based test (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> taking an application, advising on loan terms, or offering loan terms) should be broadly defined, or that any compensation paid to an employee of a manufactured home retailer to arrange financing should be included.", 
                        "The Bureau has carefully considered the comments received in response to its 2012 HOEPA Proposal, as well as in response to the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal, in light of the concerns about various issues with regard to loan originator compensation practices, the general concerns about the impacts of the ability-to-repay/qualified mortgage rule and revised HOEPA thresholds on a market in which access to mortgage credit is already extremely tight, differences between the retail and wholesale origination channels, and practical considerations regarding both the burdens of day-to-day implementation and the opportunities for evasion by parties who wish to engage in rent-seeking. As discussed further below, the Bureau is concerned about implementation burdens and anomalies created by the requirement to include loan originator compensation in points and fees, the impacts that it could have on pricing and access to credit, and the risks that rent-seekers will continue to find ways to evade the statutory scheme. Nevertheless, the Bureau believes that, in light of the historical record and of Congress's evident concern with loan originator compensation practices, it would not be appropriate to waive the statutory requirement that loan originator compensation be included in points and fees. The Bureau has, however, worked to craft the rule that implements Congress' judgment in a way that is practicable and that reduces potential negative impacts of the statutory requirement, as discussed below. The Bureau is also seeking comment in the concurrent proposal being published elsewhere in today's <em data-original=\"E-04\">Federal Register</em> on whether additional measures would better protect consumers and reduce implementation burdens and unintended consequences. \n          ", 
                        "Accordingly, the 2013 ATR Final Rule in adopting \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(ii) has generally tracked the statutory language and the Board's proposal in the regulation text, but has expanded the commentary to provide more detailed guidance to clarify what compensation must be included in points and fees. The Dodd-Frank Act requires inclusion in points and fees of \u201call compensation paid directly or indirectly by a consumer or creditor to a mortgage originator from any source, including a mortgage originator that is also the creditor in a table-funded transaction.\u201d <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> TILA section 103(bb)(4)(B). Consistent with the Board's proposal, revised &#167; 1026.32(b)(ii) as adopted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule does not include the phrase &#8220;from any source.&#8221; The Bureau agrees that the phrase is unnecessary because the provision expressly covers compensation paid &#8220;directly or indirectly&#8221; to the loan originator. Like the Board's proposal, the final rule also uses the term &#8220;loan originator&#8221; as defined in &#167; 1026.36(a)(1), not the term &#8220;mortgage originator&#8221; under section 1401 of the Dodd-Frank Act. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> TILA section 103(cc)(2). The Bureau agrees that the definitions are consistent in relevant respects and notes that it is in the process of amending the regulatory definition to harmonize it even more closely with the Dodd-Frank Act definition of &#8220;mortgage originator.&#8221;\n             Accordingly, the Bureau believes use of consistent terminology in Regulation Z will facilitate compliance. Finally, as revised, &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(ii) also does not include the language in proposed &#167; 226.32(b)(1)(ii) that specified that the provision also applies to a loan originator that is the creditor in a table-funded transaction. The Bureau has concluded that that clarification is unnecessary because a creditor in a table-funded transaction is already included in the definition of loan originator in &#167; 1026.36(a)(1). To clarify what compensation must be included in points and fees, revised &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(ii) specifies that compensation must be included if it can be attributed to the particular transaction at the time the interest rate is set. These limitations are discussed in more detail below.", 
                        "In adopting the general rule, the Bureau carefully considered arguments by industry commenters that loan originator compensation should not be included in points and fees because other statutory provisions and rules already regulate loan originator compensation, because loan originator compensation is already included in the costs of mortgage loans, and because including loan originator compensation in points and fees would push many loans over the 3 percent cap on points and fees for qualified mortgages (or even over the points and fees limits for determining whether a loan is a high-cost mortgage under HOEPA), which would increase costs and impair access to credit.", 
                        "The Bureau views the fact that other provisions within the Dodd-Frank Act address other aspects of loan originator compensation and activity as evidence of the high priority that Congress placed on regulating such compensation. The other provisions pointed to by the commenters address specific compensation practices that created particularly strong incentives for loan originators to \u201cupcharge\u201d consumers on a loan-by-loan basis and particular confusion about loan originators' loyalties. The Bureau believes that the inclusion of loan originator compensation in points and fees has distinct purposes. In addition to discouraging more generalized rent-seeking and excessive loan originator compensation, the Bureau believes that Congress may have been focused on particular risks to consumers. Thus, with respect to qualified mortgages, including loan originator compensation in points and fees helps to ensure that, in cases in which high up-front compensation might otherwise cause the creditor and/or loan originator to be less concerned about long-term sustainability, the creditor is not able to invoke a presumption of compliance if challenged to demonstrate that it made a reasonable and good faith determination of the consumer's ability to repay the loan. Similarly in HOEPA, the threshold triggers additional consumer protections, such as enhanced disclosures and housing counseling, for the loans with the highest up-front pricing.", 
                        "The Bureau recognizes that the method that Congress chose to effectuate these goals does not ensure entirely consistent results as to whether a loan is a qualified mortgage or a high-cost transaction. For instance, loans that are identical to consumers in terms of up-front costs and interest rate may nevertheless have different points and fees based on the identity of the loan originator who handled the transaction for the consumer, since different individual loan originators in a retail environment or different brokerage firms in a wholesale environment may earn different commissions from the creditor without that translating in differences in costs to the consumer. In addition, there are anomalies introduced by the fact that \u201cloan originator\u201d is defined to include mortgage broker firms and individual employees hired by either brokers or creditors, but not creditors themselves. As a result, counting the total compensation paid to a mortgage broker firm will capture both the firm's overhead costs and the compensation that the firm passes on to its individual loan officer. By contrast, in a retail transaction, the creditor would have to include in points and fees the compensation that it paid to its loan officer, but would continue to have the option of recovering its overhead costs through the interest rate, instead of an up-front charge, to avoid counting them toward the points and fees thresholds. Indeed, the Bureau expects that the new requirement may prompt creditors to shift certain other expenses into rate to stay under the thresholds.", 
                        "Nevertheless, to the extent there are anomalies from including loan originator compensation in points and fees, these anomalies appear to be the result of deliberate policy choices by Congress to expand the historical definition of points and fees to include all methods of loan originator compensation, whether derived from up-front charges or from the rate, without attempting to capture all overhead expenses by creditors or the gain on sale that the creditor can realize upon closing a mortgage. The Bureau agrees that counting loan originator compensation that is structured through rate toward the points and fees thresholds could cause some loans not to be classified as qualified mortgages and to trigger HOEPA protections, compared to existing treatment under HOEPA and its implementing regulation. However, the Bureau views this to be exactly the result that Congress intended.", 
                        "In light of the express statutory language and Congress's evident concern with increasing consumer protections in connection with high levels of loan originator compensation, the Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate to use its exception or adjustment authority in TILA section 105(a) to exclude loan originator compensation entirely from points and fees for qualified mortgages and HOEPA. As discussed below, however, the Bureau is attempting to implement the points and fees requirements with as much sensitivity as practicable to potential impacts on the pricing of and availability of credit, anomalies and unintended consequences, and compliance burdens. \n          ", 
                        "The Bureau also carefully considered comments urging it to exclude compensation paid to individual loan originators from points and fees, but ultimately concluded that such a result would be inconsistent with the plain language of the statute and could exacerbate the potential inconsistent effects of the rule on different mortgage origination channels. As noted above, many industry commenters argued that, even if loan originator compensation were not excluded altogether, at least compensation paid to individual loan originators should be excluded from points and fees. Under this approach, only payments to mortgage brokers would be included in points and fees. The commenters contended that it would be difficult to track compensation paid to individual loan originators, particularly when that compensation may be paid after consummation of the loan and that it would create substantial compliance problems. They also argued that including compensation paid to individual loan originators in points and fees would create anomalies, in which identical transactions from the consumer's perspective (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> the same interest rate and up-front costs) could nevertheless have different points and fees because of loan originator compensation.", 
                        "As explained above, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to use its exception authority to exclude loan originator compensation from points and fees, and even using that exception authority more narrowly to exclude compensation paid to individual loan originators could undermine Congress's apparent goal of providing stronger consumer protections in cases of high loan originator compensation. Although earlier versions of legislation focused specifically on compensation to \u201cmortgage brokers,\u201d which is consistent with existing HOEPA, the Dodd-Frank Act refers to compensation to \u201cmortgage originators,\u201d a term that is defined in detail elsewhere in the statute to include individual loan officers employed by both creditors and brokers, in addition to the brokers themselves. To the extent that Congress believed that high levels of loan originator compensation evidenced additional risk to consumers, excluding individual loan originators from consideration appears inconsistent with this policy judgment.", 
                        "Moreover, the Bureau notes that using exception authority to exclude compensation paid to individual loan originators would exacerbate the differential treatment between the retail and wholesale channels concerning overhead costs. As noted above, compensation paid by the consumer or creditor to the mortgage broker necessarily will include amounts for both the mortgage broker's overhead and profit and for the compensation the mortgage broker passes on to its loan officer. Excluding individual loan officer compensation on the retail side, however, would effectively exempt creditors from counting any loan originator compensation at all toward points and fees. Thus, for transactions that would be identical from the consumer's perspective in terms of interest rate and up-front costs, the wholesale transaction could have significantly higher points and fees (because the entire payment from the creditor to the mortgage broker would be captured in points and fees), while the retail transaction might include no loan origination compensation at all in points and fees. Such a result would put brokerage firms at a disadvantage in their ability to originate qualified mortgages and put them at significantly greater risk of originating HOEPA loans. This in turn could constrict the supply of loan originators and the origination channels available to consumers to their detriment.", 
                        "The Bureau recognizes that including compensation paid to individual loan originators, such as loan officers, with respect to individual transactions may impose additional burdens. For example, creditors will have to track employee compensation for purposes of complying with the rule, and the calculation of points and fees will be more complicated. However, the Bureau notes that creditors and brokers already have to monitor compensation more carefully as a result of the 2010 Loan Originator Final Rule and the related Dodd-Frank Act restrictions on compensation based on terms and on dual compensation. The Bureau also believes that these concerns can be reduced by providing clear guidance on issues such as what types of compensation are covered, when compensation is determined, and how to avoid \u201cdouble-counting\u201d payments that are already included in points and fees calculations. The Bureau has therefore revised the Board's proposed regulation and commentary to provide more detailed guidance, and is seeking comment in the proposal published elsewhere in the <em data-original=\"E-04\">Federal Register</em> today on additional guidance and potential implementation issues among other matters.", 
                        "As noted above, the Bureau is revising \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(ii) to clarify that compensation must be counted toward the points and fees thresholds if it can be attributed to the particular transaction at the time the interest rate is set. The Bureau is also revising comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-1 to explain in general terms when compensation qualifies as loan originator compensation that must be included in points and fees. In particular, compensation paid by a consumer or creditor to a loan originator is included in the calculation of points and fees, provided that such compensation can be attributed to that particular transaction at the time the interest rate is set. The Bureau also incorporates part of proposed comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-3 into revised comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-1, explaining that loan originator compensation includes amounts the loan originator retains, and is not dependent on the label or name of any fee imposed in connection with the transaction. However, revised comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-1 does not include the example from proposed comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-3, which stated that, if a loan originator imposes a processing fee and retains the fee, the fee is loan originator compensation under \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(ii) whether the originator expends the fee to process the consumer's application or uses it for other expenses, such as overhead. That example may be confusing in this context because a processing fee paid to a loan originator likely would be a finance charge under \u00a7 1026.4 and would therefore already be included in points and fees under \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i).", 
                        "Revised comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-2.i explains that compensation, such as a bonus, commission, or an award of merchandise, services, trips or similar prizes, must be included only if it can be attributed to a particular transaction. The requirement that compensation is included in points and fees only if it can be attributed to a particular transaction is consistent with the statutory language. The Dodd-Frank Act provides that, for the points and fees tests for both qualified mortgages and high-cost mortgages, only charges that are \u201cin connection with\u201d the transaction are included in points and fees. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> TILA sections 103(bb)(1)(A)(ii) (high-cost mortgages) and 129C(b)(2)(A)(vii) (qualified mortgages). Limiting loan originator compensation to compensation that is attributable to the transaction implements the statutory requirement that points and fees are &#8220;in connection&#8221; with the transaction. This limitation also makes the rule more workable. Compensation is included in points and fees only if it can be attributed to a specific transaction to facilitate compliance with the rule and avoid over-burdening creditors with complex calculations to determine, for example, the portion of a loan officer's salary that should be counted in points and fees.\n             For clarity, the Bureau has moved the discussion of the timing of loan originator compensation into new comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-3, and has added additional examples to 32(b)(1)(ii)-4, to illustrate the types and amount of compensation that should be included in points and fees.", 
                        "Revised comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-2.ii explains that loan originator compensation excludes compensation that cannot be attributed to a particular transaction at the time the interest rate is set, including, for example, compensation based on the long-term performance of the loan originator's loans or on the overall quality of the loan originator's loan files. The base salary of a loan originator is also excluded, although additional compensation that is attributable to a particular transaction must be included in points and fees. The Bureau has decided to seek further comment in the concurrent proposal regarding treatment of hourly wages for the actual number of hours worked on a particular transaction. The Board's proposal would have included hourly pay for the actual number of hours worked on a particular transaction in loan originator compensation for purposes of the points and fees thresholds, and the Bureau agrees that such wages are attributable to the particular transaction. However, the Bureau is unclear as to whether industry actually tracks compensation this way in light of the administrative burdens. Moreover, while the general rule provides for calculation of loan originator compensation at the time the interest rate is set for the reasons discussed above, the actual hours of hours worked on a transaction would not be known at that time. The Bureau is therefore seeking comment on issues relating to hourly wages, including whether to require estimates of the hours to be worked between rate set and consummation.", 
                        "New comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-3 explains that loan originator compensation must be included in the points and fees calculation for a transaction whenever the compensation is paid, whether before, at or after closing, as long as that compensation amount can be attributed to the particular transaction at the time the interest rate is set. Some industry commenters expressed concern that it would be difficult to determine the amount of compensation that would be paid after consummation and that creditors might have to recalculate loan originator compensation (and thus points and fees) after underwriting if, for example, a loan officer became eligible for higher compensation because other transactions had been consummated. The Bureau appreciates that industry participants need certainty at the time of underwriting as to whether transactions will exceed the points and fees limits for qualified mortgages (and for high-cost mortgages). To address this concern, the comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-3 explains that loan originator compensation should be calculated at the time the interest rate is set. The Bureau believes that the date the interest rate is set is an appropriate standard for calculating loan originator compensation. It would allow creditors to be able to calculate points and fees with sufficient certainty so that they know early in the process whether a transaction will be a qualified mortgage or a high-cost mortgage.", 
                        "As noted above, several industry commenters argued that including loan originator compensation in points and fees would result in double counting. They stated that creditors often will recover loan originator compensation costs through origination charges, and these charges are already included in points and fees under \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i). However, the underlying statutory provisions as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act do not express any limitation on its requirement to count loan originator compensation toward the points and fees test. Rather, the literal language of TILA section 103(bb)(4) as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act defines points and fees to include all items included in the finance charge (except interest rate), all compensation paid directly or indirectly by a consumer or creditor to a loan originator, \u201cand\u201d various other enumerated items. The use of \u201cand\u201d and the references to \u201call\u201d compensation paid \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d and \u201cfrom any source\u201d suggest that compensation should be counted as it flows downstream from one party to another so that it is counted each time that it reaches a loan originator, whatever the previous source.", 
                        "The Bureau believes the statute would be read to require that loan originator compensation be treated as additive to the other elements of points and fees. The Bureau believes that an automatic literal reading of the statute in all cases, however, would not be in the best interest of either consumers or industry. For instance, the Bureau does not believe that it is necessary or appropriate to count the same payment made by a consumer to a mortgage broker firm twice, simply because it is both part of the finance charge and loan originator compensation. Similarly, the Bureau does not believe that, where a payment from either a consumer or a creditor to a mortgage broker is counted toward points and fees, it is necessary or appropriate to count separately funds that the broker then passes on to its individual employees. In each case, any costs and risks to the consumer from high loan originator compensation are adequately captured by counting the funds a single time against the points and fees cap; thus, the Bureau does not believe the purposes of the statute would be served by counting some or all of the funds a second time, and is concerned that doing so could have negative impacts on the price and availability of credit.", 
                        "Determining the appropriate accounting rule is significantly more complicated, however, in situations in which a consumer pays some up-front charges to the creditor and the creditor pays loan originator compensation to either its own employee or to a mortgage broker firm. Because money is fungible, tracking how a creditor spends money it collects in up-front charges versus amounts collected through the rate to cover both loan originator compensation and its other overhead expenses would be extraordinarily complex and cumbersome. To facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is appropriate and necessary to adopt one or more generalized rules regarding the accounting of various payments. However, the Bureau does not believe it yet has sufficient information with which to choose definitively between the additive approach provided for in the statutory language and other potential methods of accounting for payments in light of the multiple practical and complex policy considerations involved.", 
                        "The potential downstream effects of different accounting methods are significant. Under the additive approach where no offsetting consumer payments against creditor-paid loan originator compensation is allowed, creditors whose combined loan originator compensation and up-front charges would otherwise exceed the points and fees limits would have strong incentives to cap their up-front charges for other overhead expenses under the threshold and instead recover those expenses by increasing interest rates to generate higher gains on sale. This would adversely affect consumers who prefer a lower interest rate and higher up-front costs and, at the margins, could result in some consumers being unable to qualify for credit. Additionally, to the extent creditors responded to a \u201cno offsetting\u201d rule by increasing interest rates, this could increase the number of qualified mortgages that receive a rebuttable rather than conclusive presumption of compliance.", 
                        "One alternative would be to allow all consumer payments to offset creditor-paid loan originator compensation. However, a \u201cfull offsetting\u201d approach would allow creditors to offset much higher levels of up-front points and fees against expenses paid through rate before the heightened consumer protections required by the Dodd-Frank Act would apply. Particularly under HOEPA, this may raise tensions with Congress's apparent intent. Other alternatives might use a hybrid approach depending on the type of expense, type of loan, or other factors, but would involve more compliance complexity.", 
                        "In light of the complex considerations, the Bureau believes it is necessary to seek additional notice and comment. The Bureau therefore is finalizing this rule without qualifying the statutory result and is proposing two alternative comments in the concurrent proposal, one of which would explicitly preclude offsetting, and the other of which would allow full offsetting of any consumer-paid charges against creditor-paid loan originator compensation. The Bureau is also proposing comments to clarify treatment of compensation paid by consumers to mortgage brokers and by mortgage brokers to their individual employees. The Bureau is seeking comment on all aspects of this issue, including the market impacts and whether adjustments to the final rule would be appropriate. In addition, the Bureau is seeking comment on whether it would be helpful to provide for additional adjustment of the rules or additional commentary to clarify any overlaps in definitions between the points and fees provisions in this rulemaking and the 2013 ATR Final Rule and the provisions that the Bureau is separately finalizing in connection with the Bureau's 2012 Loan Originator Compensation Proposal.", 
                        "Finally, comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-4 includes revised versions of examples in proposed comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-2, as well as additional examples to provide additional guidance regarding what compensation qualifies as loan originator compensation that must be included in points and fees. These examples illustrate when compensation can be attributed to a particular transaction at the time the interest rate is set. New comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-5 adds an example explaining how salary is treated for purposes of loan originator compensation for calculating points and fees."

Commenters noted that the Bureau's proposed &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(iii) would have required the <em data-original=\"E-03\">inclusion in points and fees</em> in certain circumstances of items that the Bureau's proposed &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(i) otherwise would have <em data-original=\"E-03\">excluded from points and fees</em> through that provision's reliance on the finance charge as the starting point for the points and fees calculation. Commenters stated that, for example, proposed &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(i) would not require the inclusion in points and fees of charges payable in a comparable cash transaction (because such charges are excluded from the definition of the finance charge), but that proposed &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(iii) nevertheless would require such charges to be included if they were among the items listed in &#167; 1026.4(c)(7) and met any of the other conditions specified in &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(iii) (<em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> the amount of the charge is unreasonable, the creditor receives direct or indirect compensation in connection with the charge, or the charge is paid to an affiliate of the creditor).\n\n             Commenters similarly noted that &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(iii) would <em data-original=\"E-03\">include</em> in points and fees charges set forth in &#167; 1026.4(c)(7) unless they are reasonable and paid to a third party, but that &#167; 1026.4(c)(7) itself specifies a list of real estate-related fees that are <em data-original=\"E-03\">excluded</em> from the definition of the finance charge (and therefore arguably excluded from points and fees under &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(i)). These commenters advocated either that the Bureau clarify whether the categories of charges discussed above are included in, or excluded from, points and fees, or that the Bureau clarify the points and fees definition by adopting a &#8220;plain English&#8221; approach. Finally, one commenter requested that the Bureau clarify whether property taxes are excluded from points and fees in all cases, regardless of whether they are reasonable in amount.", 
                                "As noted above, neither proposed 1026.32(b)(1)(i) nor proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(iii) in the Bureau's 2012 HOEPA Proposal were intended to change the types of charges included in points and fees through these provisions, or the way that these provisions work together to define points and fees. The Bureau notes that much of the complexity that exists in the existing points and fees definition and about which industry commenters complained arises from the requirement in TILA to use the finance charge as the starting point for points and fees.", 
                                "To address any uncertainty, however, the Bureau notes that commentary to \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i) as adopted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule provides an example of how \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i) and (iii) work together. Specifically, comment 32(b)(1)(i)-1, as adopted in that rulemaking, provides that, if an item meets the conditions for inclusion in points and fees specified in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(iii), then it must be included in points and fees irrespective of whether it constitutes a finance charge and, in turn, irrespective of whether it would have been included in points and fees under \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i) (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> even if payable in a comparable cash transaction). In other words, the finance charge merely constitutes the starting point for points and fees.\n            \n          ", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">&#8220;Reasonable&#8221; or &#8220;Bona Fide&#8221; Charges.</em> As noted in the section-by-section analysis of &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D) above, several industry commenters argued that the Dodd-Frank Act adopted a &#8220;bona fide,&#8221; rather than a &#8220;reasonable&#8221; standard for the exclusion from points and fees of third-party charges when it amended TILA section 103(bb)(1)(A)(ii) (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> HOEPA's points and fees coverage test) to exclude from points and fees bona fide third-party charges not retained by a creditor or its affiliate. These commenters objected to the requirement under proposed &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(iii) that the third-party charges covered by that provision be &#8220;reasonable&#8221; (as opposed to &#8220;bona fide&#8221;) to be excluded from points and fees.", 
                                "The Bureau disagrees that Congress intended that a \u201cbona fide\u201d test apply in determining whether all third-party charges may be excluded from points and fees. As noted in the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule, which interprets similar provisions of TILA for qualified mortgages,\n             at the same time that Congress added the bona fide third-party charge language to TILA in section 103(bb)(1)(A)(ii), it retained long-standing TILA section 103(aa)(4)(C), requiring that, as a pre-condition for excluding the third-party charges listed in \u00a7 1026.4(c)(7) from points and fees, that such charges be \u201creasonable.\u201d The Bureau does not believe that the new \u201cbona fide\u201d third-party charge exclusion renders the pre-existing \u201creasonable\u201d third-party charge exclusion meaningless and, in the absence of any evidence that the \u201creasonable\u201d provision has been unworkable, the Bureau declines to alter it. Instead, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D) above, the Bureau concludes, consistent with its determination in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, that \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(iii), which specifically addresses the exclusion of items listed in \u00a7 1026.4(c)(7), takes precedence over the more general exclusion for bona fide third-party charges. In response to commenters' concerns that the \u201creasonableness\u201d of third-party charges may be second-guessed, the Bureau notes its belief that the fact that a transaction for such services is conducted at arms-length ordinarily should be sufficient to ensure that the charge is reasonable.\n            \n          ", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Charges of Affiliated Settlement Service Providers.</em> Many industry commenters argued that the points and fees definition for high-cost mortgages should not distinguish between fees paid to affiliate and non-affiliate service providers. Commenters thus suggested that the Bureau use its exception authority to level the playing field either by excluding bona fide and reasonable affiliate fees from points and fees, or by requiring that all non-affiliated service provider fees be included. Commenters alternatively suggested that the Bureau require affiliate charges to be included in points and fees only to the extent that such charges are unreasonable or exceed the market price charged by unaffiliated service providers. Commenters advanced a number of arguments in support of these positions.", 
                                "Commenters argued that there is no basis for a distinction between affiliate and non-affiliate charges, notwithstanding that TILA contemplates just such a distinction for points and fees. These commenters stated that affiliate business arrangements are expressly permitted and regulated by RESPA, that the Bureau has not articulated any policy purpose or consumer benefit to including affiliate fees in points and fees, and that the Bureau's 2012 HOEPA Proposal would discourage the use of affiliates, which undercuts a goal of the Bureau's 2012 TILA-RESPA Integration Proposal to increase certainty around the cost of affiliate providers by providing for a zero tolerance for settlement charges of affiliated entities. The commenters further stated that affiliate charges, just like charges for services by unaffiliated service providers, are set largely by factors outside the creditor's control, such as market price.", 
                                "Commenters similarly argued that the HOEPA proposal's inclusion of affiliated third-party charges in points and fees would harm consumers while providing no countervailing benefit. The commenters asserted that roughly 26 percent of the market uses affiliate service providers, and that these providers offer value, convenience, efficiency, and reliability to consumers by providing \u201cone-stop shopping,\u201d speeding up loan closings, and allowing creditors to control the quality of ancillary settlement services. Commenters pointed to studies demonstrating that affiliate settlement service providers are competitive in cost with unaffiliated service providers and argued that consumers would be harmed by reduced choice and by having to pay higher prices as a result of reduced competition as lenders avoided using affiliated service providers rather than risk high-cost mortgage coverage through the points and fees threshold.", 
                                "Certain commenters expressed particular concern about the inclusion in points and fees of affiliated title charges. These commenters stated that there is no rational basis for requiring affiliated title charges to be included in points and fees, because, for example, title insurance fees are regulated at the State level either through statutorily-prescribed rates, or through a requirement that title insurance premiums be publicly filed. Commenters noted that, as a result of State regulation, there is little variation in title insurance charges from provider to provider and such charges are not subject to manipulation. In a variation of the argument that the Bureau generally should exclude affiliate settlement charges from points and fees, some commenters suggested that the Bureau should adopt a specific carve-out for affiliate title fees to the extent such fees are otherwise regulated at the State level, or to the extent that such charges are reasonable and do not exceed the cost for unaffiliated title insurance.", 
                                "The Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(iii) and related commentary in the 2013 ATR Final Rule substantially as proposed in the 2011 ATR and 2012 HOEPA Proposals.\n\n             The rationale set forth in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(iii) in the 2013 ATR Final Rule applies equally to this rulemaking. TILA section 103(bb)(4) specifically mandates that fees paid to and retained by affiliates of the creditor be included in calculating points and fees for high-cost mortgages. To exclude such fees from points and fees for purposes of determining high-cost mortgage coverage, the Bureau would have to use its exception authority under TILA section 105(a). The Bureau is aware of concerns that including fees paid to affiliates in points and fees could make it more difficult for creditors using affiliated service providers to stay under the points and fees threshold for high-cost mortgages. On the other hand, fees paid to an affiliate pose greater risks to the consumer, since affiliates of a creditor may not have to compete in the market with other providers of a service and thus may charge higher prices that get passed on to the consumer. The Bureau believes that Congress weighed these competing considerations and elected not to exclude fees paid to affiliates. Indeed, title XIV repeatedly differentiates between affiliates and independent, third-party service providers. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See, e.g.,</em> Dodd-Frank Act sections 1403, 1411, 1412, 1414, and 1431. The Bureau is not aware of any empirical evidence suggesting that Congress's election, if implemented, would affect the availability of responsible credit, or otherwise harm consumers, and therefore does not believe that it would be appropriate to use its exception authority in this instance."

One such commenter specifically noted that certain types of voluntary insurance and service contract products for manufactured homes, like homeowner's insurance, protect the consumer as beneficiary and not the creditor. This commenter requested that the Bureau clarify in commentary that such products are clearly excluded from the definition of credit property insurance. At least one industry commenter also stated that the statutory (and thus Regulation Z's) definition of points and fees contradicts itself on whether hazard insurance premiums are included. The commenter stated that hazard insurance premiums are payable in comparable cash transactions, and therefore excluded under \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i) (the finance charge prong of points and fees).

As noted in the preamble to the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate for \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(vi) to apply to the current holder of the existing mortgage loan, the servicer acting on behalf of the current holder, or an affiliate of either (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> and not to the creditor that originally made the loan, if that creditor no longer holds the loan). The entities that are listed in &#167; 1026.32(b)(1)(vi) are the entities that would refinance the transaction and, as a practical matter, gain from the prepayment penalties on the previous transaction. Accordingly, the Bureau is invoking its exception and adjustment authority under TILA section 105(a) with respect to the provision. The Bureau believes that adjusting the statutory language will more precisely target the entities in the current market environment that would benefit from refinancing loans with prepayment penalties, more effectively deter loan flipping to collect prepayment penalties, and help preserve consumers' access to safe, affordable credit. It also will lessen the compliance burden on other entities that lack an incentive for loan flipping, such as a creditor that originated the existing loan but no longer holds the loan. For these reasons, the Bureau believes that use of its exception and adjustment authority is necessary and proper under TILA section 105(a) to effectuate the purposes of and facilitate compliance with TILA. \n          "

Section 1431(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act, in turn, amended TILA by adding new section 103(bb)(5), which specifies how to calculate points and fees for HELOCs. Unlike TILA's pre-existing points and fees definition for closed-end credit transactions, which enumerates six specific categories of items that creditors must include in points and fees, the points and fees provision for HELOCs simply provides that points and fees for open-end credit plans are calculated by adding \u201cthe total points and fees known at or before closing, including the maximum prepayment penalties that may be charged or collected under the terms of the credit transaction, plus the minimum additional fees the consumer would be required to pay to draw down an amount equal to the total credit line.\u201d Thus, apart from identifying (1) maximum prepayment penalties and (2) fees to draw down an amount equal to the total credit line, the Dodd-Frank Act did not enumerate the specific items that should be included in \u201ctotal points and fees\u201d for HELOCs.",

Proposed comment 32(b)(3)(i)-1 thus would have explained that charges payable after the opening of a HELOC, for example minimum monthly finance charges and service charges based either on account activity or inactivity, need not be included in points and fees for HELOCs, even if they are included in the finance charge under \u00a7 1026.4(a) and (b). Transaction fees generally are also not included in points and fees for HELOCs, except as provided in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(3)(vi).",

Finally, the Bureau received one comment suggesting that it incorporate TILA section 103(bb)(1)(C) concerning mortgage insurance premiums into the points and fees definition for HELOCs as a prophylactic measure, even though such products typically are not associated with open-end credit plans.", 
                        "The Bureau finalizes \u00a7 1026.32(b)(3)(i) substantially as proposed, in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(2)(i). However, the Bureau omits the proposed reference to charges \u201cpayable\u201d at or before account opening. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1) above, the final rule instead clarifies that each of the charges in the points and fees calculation for HELOCs must be included (as under final \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1) for closed-end credit transactions) only if it is \u201cknown\u201d at or before account opening. The result of this change is consistency between the final rules for points and fees in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1) for closed-end credit and \u00a7 1026.32(b)(2) for HELOCs. In addition, as suggested by one commenter, the Bureau is incorporating TILA's provisions concerning mortgage insurance premiums into the definition of points and fees for HELOCs in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(2)(i)(B) and (C)."

The proposal would have implemented this provision for both closed- and open-end credit transactions in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5)(i), with a cross-reference to \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1) for the definition of loan originator.\n\n             Proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5)(i) would have specified, however, that \u201cloan originator\u201d as used in that provision meant a loan originator as that term is defined in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1), notwithstanding \u00a7 1026.36(f). The Bureau believed that such a clarification was necessary for HELOCs because originators of open-end credit plans are not, strictly speaking, \u201cmortgage originators\u201d as that term is defined in amended TILA section 103. TILA section 103(cc)(2)(A) defines a mortgage originator as a person that performs specific activities with respect to a \u201cresidential mortgage loan,\u201d and TILA section 103(cc)(5) excludes consumer credit transactions under an open-end credit plan from the definition of residential mortgage loan. Thus, on its face, TILA section 103(bb)(1)(A)(ii) could be read not to exclude from points and fees bona fide third-party charges not retained by an originator of an HELOC. As stated in the proposal, the Bureau believes bona fide third-party charges not retained by a loan originator should be excluded from points and fees whether the originator is originating a closed- or open-end credit transaction. Accordingly, proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5)(i) stated that, for purposes of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(5)(i), the term \u201cloan originator\u201d means a loan originator as that term is defined in \u00a7 1026.36(a)(1) (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> in general, an originator of any consumer mortgage credit transaction) notwithstanding &#167; 1026.36(f), which otherwise limits the term &#8220;loan originator&#8221; to persons originating closed-end credit transactions.",

Thus, the final rule for HELOCs reflects the fact that mortgage insurance premiums, certain real estate-related charges, and certain credit insurance premiums may sometimes be included in points and fees for HELOCs according to the specific requirements in &#167; 1026.32(b)(2)(i)(C), (ii), and (iii), even if those charges might otherwise have been excluded from points and fees as bona fide third-party charges."

As discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(ii), section 1431(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended TILA section 103(aa)(4)(B) to require mortgage originator compensation to be included in the existing calculation of points and fees. At the same time, however, section 1401 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended TILA section 103 to define a \u201cmortgage originator\u201d as a person who undertakes specified actions with respect to a \u201cresidential mortgage loan application\u201d or in connection with a \u201cresidential mortgage loan.\u201d Section 1401 further defined the term \u201cresidential mortgage loan\u201d to exclude a consumer credit transaction under an open-end credit plan. Given that the Dodd-Frank Act did not specify in amended TILA section 103(bb)(5) concerning HELOCs that compensation paid to originators of open-end credit plans must be included in the calculation of points and fees, the Bureau believed that it was reasonable to conclude that Congress did not intend for such compensation to be included. The Bureau believed that any incentive to evade the closed-end, high-cost mortgage points and fees threshold by structuring a transaction as a HELOC could be addressed through the prohibition in TILA against structuring a transaction as an open-end credit plan to evade HOEPA. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> TILA section 129(r); &#167; 1026.34(b), below.", 
                        "The Bureau did not propose to include loan originator compensation in points and fees for HELOCs, but the Bureau noted that amended TILA section 103(bb)(4)(G) grants the Bureau authority to include in points and fees such other charges that it determines to be appropriate. The Bureau thus requested comment on the proposed definition of points and fees for HELOCs, including on whether any additional fees should be included in the definition. In particular, the Bureau requested comment on whether compensation paid to originators should be included in the calculation of points and fees for HELOCs. The Bureau recognized that neither TILA nor Regulation Z currently addresses compensation paid to originators of HELOCs and accordingly requested comment on the operational issues that would be entailed in tracking such compensation for inclusion in the points and fees calculation. The Bureau also requested comment on whether the guidance and examples set forth in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(ii) and comments 32(b)(1)(ii)-1 and -2 concerning closed-end loan originator compensation would provide sufficient guidance to creditors calculating such compensation for HELOCs, or whether additional or different guidance would be of assistance in the open-end context.", 
                        "The Bureau received comments from both industry and consumer groups concerning its proposal to omit loan originator compensation from points and fees for HELOCs. Industry commenters supported the exclusion, with some arguing (as discussed in the section-by-section analysis above) that the exclusion should be extended to closed-end credit transactions. Consumer groups strongly objected to the Bureau's proposed exclusion of compensation to originators of HELOCs on the grounds that it would perpetuate an unwarranted distinction between closed- and open-end credit for purposes of HOEPA coverage, when Congress clearly intended that HELOCs be covered by HOEPA and subject to the same protections as closed-end credit transactions, including the provisions that the Dodd-Frank added to address perceived abuses in loan originator compensation. Consumer groups similarly argued that the Bureau's proposal to rely on the anti-structuring provision in \u00a7 1026.34(b) was \u201cdangerously na\u00efve.\u201d No commenters provided information concerning the operational burdens that HELOC creditors might face in tracking loan originator compensation, or on whether closed-end guidance for calculating loan originator compensation would be sufficient to provide guidance to HELOC creditors.", 
                        "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(ii), the Bureau is adopting in the 2013 ATR Final Rule a requirement to include in points and fees compensation paid to loan originators, and is providing guidance for determining what types of compensation, and how much compensation, needs to be included. The Bureau is persuaded that requiring loan originator compensation to be included in points and fees for closed-end credit, while exempting it for open-end credit, could lead to undesirable results, such as creditors steering consumers to open-end credit where a closed-end product would be more appropriate. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting in the final rule a requirement that creditors include compensation paid to originators of open-end credit plans, to the same extent that such compensation is required to be included for closed-end credit transactions.", 
                        "To provide the public with an additional opportunity to give feedback concerning what further guidance may be needed to calculate and include loan originator compensation for open-end credit in points and fees, the Bureau is soliciting comment on this issue in the concurrent proposal that is being published today."

Commenters observed that these conditions cannot be known at account opening, thus the amount of participation charge to be included in points and fees over the term of the HELOC cannot be known at account opening. Commenters suggested various alternatives for including participation fees in points and fees for HELOCs, such as requiring the fees to be included only if they are payable at or before account opening, or requiring them to be included only for the first three years of the account (after which the consumer could close the account without facing a prepayment penalty if the consumer objected to paying the fee).

For example, one creditor's \u201cpar rate\u201d may be higher or lower than another's based on whether the creditor absorbs secondary market costs such as LLPAs and processing fees or passes them on to the consumer. Such factors could impact the creditor's discount point pricing. Certain other commenters requested guidance for how creditors making portfolio loans with discount points could establish that the discount point is \u201cbona fide,\u201d given that the proposed test would have been tied to the secondary market.", 
                                "As discussed at length in the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau is adopting in that rulemaking a definition of \u201cbona fide discount point\u201d with certain modifications from what was proposed in the 2011 ATR and 2012 HOEPA Final Rules. In brief, the Bureau is removing the proposed requirement that interest rate reductions take into account secondary market considerations. Instead, as revised, \u00a7 1026.32(b)(3) requires only that the calculation of the interest rate reduction be consistent with established industry practices for determining the amount of reduction in the interest rate or time-price differential appropriate for the amount of discount points paid by the consumer. As noted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau finds that removing the secondary market component of the \u201cbona fide\u201d discount point definition is necessary and proper under TILA section 105(a) to effectuate the purposes of and facilitate compliance with TILA. In particular, the exception is necessary and proper to permit creditors sufficient flexibility to demonstrate that they are in compliance with the requirement that discount points are bona fide. These same considerations regarding facilitating compliance apply equally in the high-cost mortgage context.", 
                                "To further assist creditors in the bona fide discount point calculation for high-cost mortgages and qualified mortgages, the Bureau is adopting in the 2013 ATR Final Rule new comment 32(b)(3)-1, which provides examples of methods that a creditor can use to determine whether a discount point is \u201cbona fide.\u201d The examples are discussed in further detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(4) in the ATR Final Rule."

                        "As noted, the Bureau proposed to move existing comment 32(a)(1)(ii)-1 concerning calculation of the \u201ctotal loan amount\u201d for points and fees to proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(6)(i) and comment 32(b)(6)(i)-1 and to specify that the calculation applies to closed-end credit transactions. The Bureau also proposed to amend the definition of \u201ctotal loan amount\u201d so that the \u201camount financed,\u201d as calculated pursuant to \u00a7 1026.18(b), would no longer be the starting point for the total loan amount calculation. The Bureau proposed this amendment both because the Bureau believed that it would streamline the total loan amount calculation and because the Bureau believed the revisions were sensible in light of the more inclusive definition of the finance charge proposed in the Bureau's 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal. In the preamble of the HOEPA proposal, the Bureau noted that one effect of the proposed more inclusive finance charge generally could have been to reduce the \u201camount financed\u201d for many transactions. The Bureau thus proposed not to rely on the \u201camount financed\u201d calculation as the starting point for the \u201ctotal loan amount\u201d in HOEPA. The Bureau instead proposed to define \u201ctotal loan amount\u201d as the amount of credit extended at consummation that the consumer is legally obligated to repay, as reflected in the loan contract, less any cost that is both included in points and fees under \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1) and financed by the creditor. Proposed comment 32(b)(6)(i)-1 would have provided an example of the Bureau's proposed \u201ctotal loan amount\u201d calculation for closed-end credit transactions.", 
                        "The Bureau requested comment on the appropriateness of its revised definition of \u201ctotal loan amount,\u201d and particularly on whether additional guidance was needed in light of the prohibition against financing of points and fees for high-cost mortgages. Specifically, the Bureau noted that, under the 2012 HOEPA Proposal, financed points are relevant for two purposes. First, financed points and fees must be excluded from the total loan amount for purposes of determining whether a closed-end credit transaction is covered by HOEPA under the points and fees threshold. Second, if a transaction is a high-cost mortgage through operation of any of the HOEPA triggers, the creditor is prohibited from financing points and fees by, for example, including points and fees in the note amount or financing them through a separate note. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> the section-by-section analysis of &#167; 1026.34(a)(10) below.", 
                        "The 2012 HOEPA Proposal noted that, notwithstanding HOEPA's ban on the financing of points and fees for high-cost mortgages, for purposes of determining HOEPA coverage (and thus whether the ban applies) creditors should be required to deduct from the amount of credit extended to the consumer any points and fees that the creditor would finance if the transaction were not subject to HOEPA.\n             In this way, the percentage limit on points and fees for determining HOEPA coverage would be based on the amount of credit extended to the borrower without taking into account any points and fees that would (if permitted) be financed. The preamble to the 2012 HOEPA Proposal provided an example to illustrate how the provisions concerning financed points and fees in proposed \u00a7\u00a7 1026.32(b)(6)(i) and 1026.34(a)(10) would have worked together.", 
                        "The Bureau received numerous comments concerning its proposed amendment to the total loan amount calculation for closed-end credit transactions. The comments, from both industry and consumer groups, generally requested that the calculation be clarified prior to its finalization. The Bureau received no comments seeking further guidance or clarification concerning the interaction of the total loan amount calculation and the prohibition against financing of points and fees for high-cost mortgages.", 
                        "After further consideration, the Bureau has determined not to adopt at this time the proposed revisions to the total loan amount calculation for closed-end credit transactions. The Bureau notes that it likely will revisit this subject when it issues a final rule concerning the proposed more inclusive finance charge. Thus, the Bureau adopts the total loan amount definition for closed-end credit transactions as separately finalized in connection with the 2013 ATR Final Rule. As finalized therein, the total loan amount for a closed-end credit transaction is calculated consistently with existing comment 32(a)(1)(ii)-1, except that the Bureau is adopting certain clarifications to reflect the operation of other, new provisions under TILA. For example, the total loan amount calculation examples, which discuss whether and when to subtract financed points and fees from the amount financed, are revised so that they no longer refer to the financing of credit life insurance, because the financing of most such insurance is prohibited under TILA section 129C(d)."

Proposed comment 32(b)(8)-1.i through -1.iv would have given examples of prepayment penalties for closed-end credit transactions, including (among others) (1) a charge determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding for a period of time after prepayment in full and applying the interest rate to such \u201cbalance,\u201d even if the charge results from interest accrual amortization used for other payments in the transaction under the terms of the loan contract; and (2) a fee, such as an origination or other loan closing cost, that is waived by the creditor on the condition that the consumer does not prepay the loan.

Based on the differing approaches taken by the Board in its recent mortgage proposals, however, the Bureau's HOEPA proposal sought comment on whether a minimum finance charge should be listed as an example of a prepayment penalty and whether loan guarantee fees should be excluded from the definition of prepayment penalty.", 
                                "The Bureau's HOEPA proposal noted that it expected to coordinate the definition of prepayment penalty in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(8)(i) with the definitions in the Bureau's other pending rulemakings mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act concerning ability-to-repay, TILA-RESPA mortgage disclosure integration, and mortgage servicing.

The Bureau is adopting proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(8)(i) as \u00a7 1026.32(b)(6)(i) in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, with certain changes from the 2012 HOEPA Proposal to address comments received, as discussed below. As adopted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule and as discussed further therein, comments 32(b)(6)-1 and -2 provide examples of payments that are (and are not) prepayment penalties in the case of closed-end credit transactions.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Post-payoff interest charges.</em> Several commenters expressed serious concern about the Bureau's proposal to include in the definition of prepayment penalty for closed-end credit transactions the assessment of interest for periods after the borrower pays in full. Commenters voiced concern about the potential impact of this provision on FHA lending. FHA loans, based on a monthly interest accrual amortization method, are subject to a policy under which interest may accrue and be charged to the consumer for a partial month after a full payoff. Given that FHA loans can be paid off well beyond 36 months (the maximum time period during which a prepayment penalty may be imposed without triggering HOEPA), defining prepayment penalty to include such interest would effectively cause FHA loans to trigger HOEPA unless the FHA changes its policy going forward.\n             Commenters stated that the Bureau should either define prepayment penalties to exclude interest payments that are imposed for the balance of a month in which a consumer repays a mortgage loan in full, or the Bureau should work with FHA prior to the change taking effect to avoid disruption to industry and, in turn, to borrowers.", 
                                "As discussed in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau is not removing or substantively amending comment 32(b)(6)-1.i, which specifies that the practice of charging a consumer interest after the consumer prepays the loan in full is a prepayment penalty. As noted in that rulemaking, the Bureau includes the interest calculation as an example of a prepayment penalty in comment 32(b)(6)-1.i chiefly because such methodology penalizes the consumer by requiring the consumer to pay interest for a period after the loan has been paid in full. The inclusion of this example is also consistent with long-standing Regulation Z commentary accompanying \u00a7 1026.18 that requires such charges to be disclosed as prepayment penalties, as well as with Board Regulation Z proposals from 2009 and 2010.\n            \n          ", 
                                "However, with respect to FHA practices relating to monthly interest accrual amortization, the Bureau has consulted extensively with HUD in issuing this final rule as well as the 2013 ATR Final Rule. Based on these consultations, the Bureau understands that HUD must engage in rulemaking to end its practice of imposing interest charges on consumers for the balance of the month in which consumers prepay in full. The Bureau further understands that HUD requires approximately 24 months to complete its rulemaking process. Accordingly, in recognition of the important role that FHA-insured credit plays in the current mortgage market and to facilitate FHA creditors' ability to comply with this aspect of the 2013 HOEPA and ATR Final Rules, the Bureau is using its authority under TILA section 105(a) to provide for optional compliance until January 21, 2015 with \u00a7 1026.32(b)(6)(i) and the official interpretation of that provision in comment 32(b)(6)-1.i regarding monthly interest accrual amortization. Specifically, \u00a7 1026.32(b)(6)(i) provides that interest charged consistent with the monthly interest accrual amortization method is not a prepayment penalty for FHA loans consummated before January 21, 2015. FHA loans consummated on or after January 21, 2015 must comply with all aspects of the final rule. The Bureau is making this adjustment pursuant to its authority under TILA section 105(a), which provides that the Bureau's regulations may contain such additional requirements, classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for all or any class of transactions as in the Bureau's judgment are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA, prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or facilitate compliance therewith. 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). The Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to make this adjustment to facilitate compliance with TILA and its purposes while mitigating the risk of disruption to the market. For purposes of this rulemaking, the Bureau specifically notes that the inclusion of interest charged consistent with the monthly interest accrual amortization method in the definition of prepayment penalty for purposes of determining whether a transaction has exceeded the high-cost mortgage prepayment penalty or points and fees coverage tests (and, in turn, whether the transaction has violated the prohibition against prepayment penalties for high-cost mortgages) applies only to transactions consummated on or after January 10, 2014; for FHA loans, compliance with this aspect of the definition or prepayment penalties is optional for transactions consummated prior to January 21, 2015.", 
                                "<em data-original=\"E-03\">Conditionally-waived closing costs.</em> Several commenters expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed inclusion of conditionally-waived closing costs as prepayment penalties for closed-end credit transactions. The commenters noted that the 2012 HOEPA Proposal would have excluded such waived closing costs from the definition of prepayment penalty for HELOCs, provided that the costs represented bona fide third-party charges and were recouped only in the case of prepayments occurring within the first 36 months after account opening. As with other aspects of the Proposal that applied different treatment to open- versus closed-end credit, consumer groups argued that waived closing costs should be considered prepayment penalties in all cases. Some industry commenters, on the other hand, argued that all waived closing charges (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> not only bona fide third-party charges, and not only such charges that the creditor might recoup during the first three years) should be excluded from the definition of prepayment penalty for both closed- and open-end credit. Other industry commenters requested that the exemption from prepayment penalties for waived third-party charges proposed for HELOCs apply equally to closed-end subordinate-lien loans, because creditors commonly waive third-party fees on those loans as they do for HELOCs. One commenter suggested that the rule be clarified so that a charge, such as taxes, which would not be included in points and fees if the consumer paid it at closing would not be included in points and fees through the prepayment penalty prong if the creditor waived that charge but required it to be repaid if the consumer prepaid the loan or terminated the plan early. Another commenter noted that there is a practice of waiving closing costs on smaller transactions on the condition that the consumer does not prepay within three years of consummation or account opening. This commenter expressed concern that treatment of those costs as prepayment penalties would exceed the two percent HOEPA prepayment penalty trigger, thus unfairly burdening small-dollar-value lending.", 
                                "The Bureau is also adopting language and adding an example in the 2013 ATR Final Rule to comment 32(b)(6)-1.ii to clarify that, for closed-end credit transactions (as for HELOCs), the term \u201cprepayment penalty\u201d does not include conditionally-waived, bona fide third-party closing charges that the creditor may impose on the consumer if the consumer prepays the loan in full within 36 months of consummation.", 
                                "The Bureau believes that excluding such charges from the definition of prepayment penalty for both closed- and open-end credit is the only practicable way to make the various provisions of HOEPA relating to prepayment penalties and points and fees work sensibly together. In this regard, the Bureau notes that bona fide third-party charges that the consumer pays upfront and that are not paid to or retained by the creditor or its affiliate are excluded from the definition of points and fees for closed-end credit transactions under \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D). By contrast, if the same bona fide third-party charges, waived on the condition that the consumer does not prepay the loan in full, are defined as prepayment penalties, then such charges would be required to be included in points and fees (through the prepayment penalty prong) even though the consumer may never actually pay those fees. The Bureau believes that treating a conditionally-waived charge that would not otherwise be included in points and fee as a prepayment penalty would penalize the creditor for the conditional waiver and deter creditors from making these offers to the detriment of consumers. As noted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau recognizes that the creditor receives no profit from imposing or collecting such bona fide third-party charges, and the Bureau believes that treating such charges as a prepayment penalty might very well have the effect of reducing consumer choice without providing any commensurate consumer benefit. In an effort to provide a sensible way to permit a creditor to protect itself from losing money paid at closing to third parties on the consumer's behalf, prior to such time as the creditor can otherwise recoup such costs through the interest rate on the mortgage loan, while balancing consumer protection interests, the Bureau has concluded that such fees should be permissible for a limited time after consummation for closed-end credit transactions."

Proposed comment 32(b)(8)-2 would have further clarified that the term \u201cprepayment penalty\u201d includes a waived closing cost that must be repaid if the consumer terminates the plan prior to the end of its term, except that the repayment of waived bona fide third-party charges if the consumer terminates the credit plan within 36 months after account opening is not considered a prepayment penalty. The Bureau's proposal provided for a threshold of 36 months to clarify that, if the terms of an open-end credit plan permit a creditor to charge a consumer for waived third-part closing costs when, for example, the consumer terminates the plan in year nine of a ten-year plan, such charges would be considered prepayment penalties and would cause the open-end credit plan to be classified as a high-cost mortgage.\n            \n          ",

For the reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7 1026.32(b)(6)(i) above, the Bureau has determined to exclude conditionally-waived, bona fide third-party closing costs from the definition of prepayment penalty for closed-end credit transactions where the terms of the transaction provide that the creditor may recoup those costs from the consumer if the consumer prepays the transaction in full sooner than 36 months after consummation. With this change, the Bureau believes there is parity between closed- and open-end credit transactions for prepayment penalties."

                        "The Bureau proposed comment 32(c)(2)-1 to clarify how to disclose the annual percentage rate for an open-end high-cost mortgage. Specifically, proposed comment 32(c)(2)-1 would have clarified that creditors must comply with \u00a7 1026.6(a)(1), which sets forth the general requirements for determination and disclosure of finance charges associated with open-end credit plans. In addition, the proposed comment would have stated that if the transaction offers a fixed-rate for a period of time, such as a discounted initial interest rate, \u00a7 1026.32(c)(2) requires a creditor to disclose the annual percentage rate of the fixed-rate discounted initial interest rate, and the rate that would apply when the feature expires.", 
                        "The proposed rule would have made clarifications to \u00a7 1026.32(c)(3), which requires disclosure of the regular payment and the amount of any balloon payment. Balloon payments generally are no longer permitted for high-cost mortgages, except in certain narrow circumstances, as discussed below. Proposed \u00a7 1026.32(c)(3)(i) would have incorporated the requirement in current \u00a7 1026.32(c)(3) for closed-end credit transactions and clarified that the balloon payment disclosure is required to the extent a balloon payment is specifically permitted under \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1).", 
                        "For open-end credit plans, a creditor may not be able to provide a disclosure on the \u201cregular\u201d payment applicable to the plan because the regular monthly (or other periodic) payment will depend on factors that will not be known at the time the disclosure is required, such as the amount of the extension(s) of credit on the line and the rate applicable at the time of the draw or the time of the payment. To facilitate compliance and to provide consumers with meaningful disclosures, the Bureau proposed \u00a7 1026.32(c)(3)(ii) to require creditors to disclose an example of a minimum periodic payment for open-end high-cost mortgages. Accordingly, proposed \u00a7 1026.32(c)(3)(ii)(A) would have provided that, for open-end credit plans, a creditor must disclose payment examples showing the first minimum periodic payment for the draw period and, if applicable, any repayment period and the balance outstanding at the beginning of any repayment period. Furthermore, the proposal would have required this example to be based on the following assumptions: (1) The consumer borrows the full credit line, as disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 1026.32(c)(5)(ii) at account opening and does not obtain any additional extensions of credit; (2) the consumer makes only minimum periodic payments during the draw period and any repayment period; and (3) the annual percentage rate used to calculate the sample payments will remain the same during the draw period and any repayment period. Proposed \u00a7 1026.32(c)(3)(ii)(A)(3) further would have required that the creditor provide the minimum periodic payment example based on the annual percentage rate for the plan, as described in \u00a7 1026.32(c)(2), except that if an introductory annual percentage rate applies, the creditor must use the rate that would otherwise apply to the plan after the introductory rate expires.", 
                        "As discussed in detail below, the Bureau proposed \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(iii) to provide an exemption to the prohibition on balloon payments for certain open-end credit plans. Accordingly, to the extent permitted under \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1), proposed \u00a7 1026.32(c)(3)(ii)(B) would have required disclosure of that fact and the amount of the balloon payment based on the assumptions described in \u00a7 1026.32(c)(3)(ii)(A).", 
                        "To reduce potential consumer confusion, proposed \u00a7 1026.32(c)(3)(ii)(C) would have required that a creditor provide a statement explaining the assumptions upon which the \u00a7 1026.32(c)(3)(ii)(A) payment examples are based. Furthermore, for the same reason, proposed \u00a7 1026.32(c)(3)(ii)(D) would have required a statement that the examples are not the consumer's actual payments and that the consumer's actual periodic payments will depend on the amount the consumer has borrowed and interest rate applicable to that period. The Bureau believes that without such statements, consumers could misunderstand the minimum payment examples.", 
                        "The Bureau solicited comment on these proposed statements and whether other language would be appropriate and beneficial to consumer. The Bureau did not receive any comments addressing these issues. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1026.32(c)(3) as proposed.", 
                        "The Bureau also proposed to revise comment 32(c)(3)-1 to reflect the expanded statutory restriction on balloon payments and to clarify that to the extent a balloon payment is permitted under \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1), the balloon payment must be disclosed under \u00a7 1026.32(c)(3)(i). In addition, the Bureau proposed to renumber current comment 32(c)(3)-1 as proposed comment 32(c)(3)(i)-1 for organizational purposes. The Bureau did not receive any comments addressing revised comment 32(c)(3)-1, and accordingly is adopting comment 32(c)(3)(i)-1 as proposed, with a minor revision for consistency with Regulation Z terminology.", 
                        "In order to provide additional guidance on the application of \u00a7 1026.32(c)(4) to open-end credit plans, the Bureau proposed to revise comment 32(c)(4)-1. For an open-end credit plan, comment 32(c)(4)-1 would have provided that the disclosure of the maximum monthly payment, as required under \u00a7 1026.32(c)(4), must be based on the following assumptions: (1) The consumer borrows the full credit line at account opening with no additional extensions of credit; (2) the consumer makes only minimum periodic payments during the draw period and any repayment period; and (3) the maximum annual percentage rate that may apply under the payment plan, as required by \u00a7 1026.30, applies to the plan at account opening. Although actual payments on the plan may depend on various factors, such as the amount of the draw and the rate applicable at that time, the Bureau believes this approach is consistent with existing guidance to calculate the \u201cworst-case\u201d payment example. The Bureau received no comments on this aspect of the proposal, and accordingly is adopting comment 32(c)(4)-1 as proposed.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed to amend \u00a7 1026.32(c)(5) to clarify the disclosure requirements for open-end credit plans. In the proposal, the Bureau noted that the amount borrowed can be ascertained in a closed-end credit transaction but typically is not known at account opening for an open-end credit plan. Specifically, proposed \u00a7 1026.32(c)(5)(ii) would have provided that for open-end transactions, a creditor must disclose the credit limit applicable to the plan. Because HELOCs are open-end (revolving) lines of credit, the amount borrowed depends on the amount drawn on the plan at any time. Thus, the Bureau believes that disclosing the credit limit is a more appropriate and meaningful disclosure to the consumer than the total amount borrowed.", 
                        "The Bureau also proposed technical revisions to the existing requirements for closed-end credit transactions under \u00a7 1026.32(c)(5) and to the guidance under comment 32(c)(5)-1. Upon further consideration of these provisions, the Bureau recognizes that the prohibition of financing points and fees in final \u00a7 1026.34(a)(10) will prohibit the financing of any points and fees, as defined in \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1) and (2) for all high-cost mortgages. This prohibition thus includes the financing of optional credit insurance or debt cancellation coverage described in existing \u00a7 1026.32(c)(5), as well as \u201cpremiums or other charges for any credit life, credit disability, credit unemployment, or credit property insurance, or any other life, accident, health, or loss-of-income insurance for which the creditor is the beneficiary, as well as any payments directly or indirectly for any debt cancellation or suspension agreement or contract\u201d as described in existing comment 32(c)(5)-1. Accordingly, the disclosure for high-cost mortgages required by \u00a7 1026.32(c)(5) should not include premiums or other charges for debt cancellation coverage or other charges that are included in the calculation of points and fees, and thereby prohibited from being financed under \u00a7 1026.34(a)(10). Section 34(a)(10) does not prohibit, however, the financing of certain bona fide third-party charges that are not considered \u201cpoints and fees,\u201d such as fees charged by a third-party counselor in connection with the consumer's receipt of pre-loan counseling under \u00a7 1025.34(a)(5). Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1026.32(c)(5) with revisions for clarification and consistency with final \u00a7\u00a7 1026.32(b)(2) and 1026.34(a)(10), and eliminating comment 32(c)(5)-1."

                                "The Bureau proposed two alternatives in proposed \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(i) to define balloon payments for purposes of implementing HOEPA's new restrictions on these payments. Under Alternative 1, proposed \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(i) would have incorporated the statutory language and defined \u201cballoon payment\u201d as a scheduled payment that is more than twice as large as the average of regular periodic payments. Under Alternative 2, the rule would have mirrored Regulation Z's existing definition of \u201cballoon payment\u201d in \u00a7 1026.18(s)(5)(i). Accordingly, proposed \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(i) would have provided that a balloon payment is \u201ca payment schedule with a payment that is more than two times a regular periodic payment.\u201d This definition is similar to the statutory definition under the Dodd-Frank Act, except that it uses as its benchmark any regular periodic payment, rather than the average of earlier scheduled payments.", 
                                "The Bureau noted in the proposal that, in its view, Alternative 2 would better protect consumers and their interests, but solicited comment on both alternatives. As stated in the proposal, because the existing regulatory definition is narrower than the statutory definition, the Bureau believes that a payment that is twice any one regular periodic payment would be equal to or less than a payment that is twice the average of earlier scheduled payments. The Bureau noted that the range of scheduled payment amounts under Alternative 2 is more limited and defined. For example, if the regular periodic payment on a high-cost mortgage is $200, a payment of greater than $400 would constitute a balloon payment. Under Alternative 1, however, the balloon payment amount could be greater than $400 if, for example, the regular periodic payments were increased by $100 each year. Under Alternative 1, the amount constituting a balloon payment could increase with the incremental increase of the average of earlier scheduled payments. Under either alternative, a high-cost mortgage generally must provide for fully amortizing payments.", 
                                "The Bureau solicited comment on whether the difference in wording between the statutory definition and the existing regulatory definition, as a practical matter, would yield a significant difference in what constitutes a \u201cballoon payment\u201d in the high-cost mortgage context. The Bureau did not receive any comments that persuasively suggested Alternative 1 was preferable to Alternative 2.", 
                                "The Bureau is adopting Alternative 2 as proposed, pursuant to its authority under TILA section 129(p)(1). TILA section 129(p)(1) allows the Bureau to exempt specific mortgage products or categories of mortgages from certain prohibitions under TILA section 129 if the Bureau finds that the exemption is in the interest of the borrowing public and will apply only to products that maintain and strengthen homeownership and equity protection. The Bureau believes that under Alternative 2, consumers would have a better understanding of the highest possible regular periodic payment in a repayment schedule and may experience less \u201cpayment shock\u201d as a result. Therefore, the Bureau believes that Alternative 2 would better protect consumers and be in their interest. In addition, the Bureau believes that the definition of balloon payment under Alternative 2 would facilitate and simplify compliance by providing creditors with a single definition within Regulation Z and alleviating the need to average earlier scheduled payments. The Bureau notes that a similar adjustment is being adopted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule and was proposed in the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal.", 
                                "The Bureau also adopts proposed comment 32(d)(1)(i)-1, which provides further guidance on the application of \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(i) under Alternative 2. Specifically, the comment clarifies that for purposes of open-end transactions, the term \u201cregular periodic payment\u201d or \u201cperiodic payment\u201d means the required minimum periodic payment.",

Proposed \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(i) would have been applicable to open-end credit plans. However, for an open-end credit plan that has both a draw period and a repayment period during which no further draws may betaken\u2014a structure the Bureau believes is common for open-end plans\u2014proposed \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(iii) would have made the limitations of\u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(i) applicable only to the repayment period. Given that \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(i) defines a balloon payment as any payment that is more than twice the regular periodic payment, any open-end credit plan that converts from smaller interest-only payments to larger fully amortizing payments could be considered a balloon payment if the post-conversion payment is more than twice the interest-only payment during the draw period. As stated in the 2012 HOEPA Proposal, the purpose of the proposed exclusion of the draw period from the balloon limitation for this type of open-end plan was to provide creditors with flexibility to offer products with beneficial payment features.", 
                                "The Bureau is adopting proposed \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(iii) with revisions to clarify that the exception to \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(i) applies to any adjustment in the regular periodic payment that results solely from the credit plan's transition from the draw period to the repayment period. The Bureau believes this revision alleviates any concern that proposed \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(iii) would have allowed balloon payments during the draw period in other situations. The Bureau is also adding new comment 32(d)(1)-2 to provide further guidance on how the balloon payment restriction applies to open-end credit plans with both a draw and repayment period, including a clarification that the limitation in \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(i) does not apply to any increases in regular periodic payments that result from the initial draw or additional draws on the credit line during the draw period.

Industry groups and some community banks pointed out that bridge loans are currently covered by HOEPA, and an exemption to the pre-Dodd Frank Act restrictions on balloon payments was in place to prevent unnecessarily restricting access to short-term bridge loans for consumers. In particular, commenters stated that, because all short-term bridge loans are structured with balloon payments, the effect of this removal would be to prohibit any bridge loan that is classified as a high-cost mortgage. Some commenters suggested that the Bureau retain the existing exemption for temporary or bridge loans of less than 12 months as exists in current \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii), while one commenter suggested that the Bureau provide an exemption for temporary bridge loans of 12 months or less.", 
                                "The Bureau agrees with these commenters that the proposed rule would have unnecessarily banned any short term bridge loans covered by HOEPA. Accordingly, final \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1)(ii) retains an exemption to the restriction on balloon payments for short-term bridge loans made in connection with the acquisition of a new dwelling. In addition, because it is the Bureau's understanding that temporary or short-term \u201cbridge\u201d loans are commonly structured as 12-month balloons, the Bureau is adopting the commenter's suggestion of bridge loans of terms of 12 months or less.", 
                                "The Bureau is retaining this exemption as modified pursuant to its authority under TILA section 129(p), which grants the Bureau authority to exempt specific mortgage products or categories from any or all of the prohibitions specified in TILA section 129(c) through (i) if the Bureau finds that the exemption is in the interest of the borrowing public and will apply only to products that maintain and strengthen homeownership and equity protections. The Bureau believes this approach is in the interest of the borrowing public and will strengthen homeownership and equity protection, because it is consistent with the historical and current treatment of bridge loans under HOEPA and will not unduly restrict access to temporary bridge financing for consumers. The Bureau further believes that improving access to short-term bridge financing will strengthen homeownership and equity protection by better allowing homeowners who need to sell a current residence in order to purchase a new one access to short-term financing to do so. Finally, the Bureau believes that adopting an exemption for short-term bridge loans of 12 months or less, as opposed to the current exemption for short-term bridge loans of less than 12 months, is also in the interest of the borrowing public because it will remove an unnecessary barrier to short-term financing in its usual 12-month form, at negligible if any cost to consumer protection. The Bureau does not believe that permitting a term of 12 months or less, as opposed to 11 months and 30 days or less, presents an increased risk of abuse to consumers. In addition, permitting balloons for bridge loans with a term of 12 months or less is consistent with the 2013 ATR Final Rule and 2013 Escrows Final Rule."

The Bureau did not propose different treatment for loans made by creditors in rural or underserved areas.", 
                                "A significant number of industry commenters, especially community banks, objected generally to the balloon payment restriction. These commenters expressed concerns that the 2012 HOEPA Proposal would have prohibited them from making balloon loans that fall within the new HOEPA thresholds, which may have a significant adverse effect on their businesses given that the thresholds for high-cost mortgages are being expanded by the statute. These commenters argued that balloon loans are important to serve the needs of their customers, especially in rural areas, and banks in these areas use balloon loans to manage their risks and safety and soundness concerns. Commenters asked for various types of relief, including that the prohibition be lifted entirely; that community banks be exempt from the prohibition if the balloon loan is held in portfolio; or that balloon payments be permitted so long as they are only for a final payment.", 
                                "The Bureau notes that it is including an exemption to the balloon payment restrictions on qualified mortgages for certain loans made by creditors in \u201crural\u201d or \u201cunderserved\u201d areas in the 2013 ATR Final Rule. As more fully explained in that rule, the Bureau is allowing for certain qualified mortgages to contain balloon payments provided that (1) The loan meets all of the criteria for a qualified mortgage, with certain exceptions; (2) the creditor makes a determination that the consumer is able to make all scheduled payments, except the balloon payment, out of income or assets other than the collateral; (3) the loan is underwritten based on a payment schedule that fully amortizes the loan over a period of not more than 30 years and takes into account all applicable mortgage-related obligations; (4) the loan is not originated in conjunction with a forward commitment and is held in portfolio for at least three years; and (5) the creditor meets prescribed qualifications. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167;&#167; 1026.43(f)(1)(i)-(vi) and 1026.43(f)(2). Those qualifications are that the creditor: (1) Operates predominantly in rural or underserved areas; (2) together with all affiliates, has total annual residential mortgage loan originations that do not exceed 500 first-lien covered transactions per year; (3) retains the balloon payment loans in portfolio; and (4) has less than $2 billion in assets. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167;&#167; 1026.43(f)(1)(vi) and 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A), (B), (C).\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Bureau agrees with commenters that allowing creditors in certain rural or underserved areas to extend high-cost mortgages with balloon payments could benefit consumers by expanding access to credit in these areas, and also would facilitate compliance for creditors who make these loans. The Bureau thus believes that balloon payments should not be prohibited for high-cost mortgages in rural or underserved areas, provided the creditor meets certain criteria that balance the need for access to credit with appropriate consumer protections. In the Bureau's view, the 2013 ATR Final Rule provides an appropriate framework for determining when a high-cost mortgage may be permitted to contain a balloon payment. Further, allowing creditors who make high-cost mortgages in rural or underserved areas to originate loans with balloon payments if they satisfy the same criteria promotes consistency between the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule and the 2013 ATR Final Rule, and thereby facilitates compliance for creditors who operate in these areas. Thus, as adopted, \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1) grants a limited exemption from the balloon payment prohibition for creditors that make high-cost mortgages with balloon payments, but that also meet the conditions set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 1026.43(f)(1)(i) through (vi) and 1026.43(f)(2), as adopted by the 2013 ATR Final Rule.", 
                                "The Bureau is providing this exemption pursuant to its authority under TILA section 129(p)(1), which grants it authority to exempt specific mortgage products or categories from any or all of the prohibitions specified in TILA section 129(c) through (i) if the Bureau finds that the exemption is in the interest of the borrowing public and will apply only to products that maintain and strengthen homeownership and equity protections. The Bureau believes the balloon payment exemption for high-cost mortgages is in the interest of the borrowing public and will strengthen homeownership and equity protection. Allowing greater access to credit in rural or underserved areas will help those consumers who may be able to obtain credit only from a limited number of creditors obtain mortgages. Further, it will do so in a manner that balances consumer protections with access to credit. In the Bureau's view, concerns about potentially abusive practices that may accompany balloon payments will be curtailed by the additional requirements set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 1026.43(f)(1)(i) through (vi). Creditors who make these high-cost mortgages will be required to verify that the loans also satisfy a number of additional criteria, including some specific criteria required for qualified mortgages. Further, as fully discussed in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, creditors that make balloon high-cost mortgages under this exception will be required to hold the high-cost mortgages in portfolio for a specified time, which the Bureau believes also decreases the risk of abusive lending practices. Accordingly, for these reasons and for the purpose of consistency between the two rulemakings, the Bureau is amending the final rule to include an exemption to the \u00a7 1026.32(d)(1) balloon restriction for high-cost mortgages where the creditor satisfies the conditions set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 1026.43(f)(1)(i) through (vi) and 1026.43(f)(2)."

The Bureau also proposed comments to provide additional clarification and examples of when acceleration under proposed \u00a7 1026.32(d)(8) would be permitted. The Bureau sought comment from the public on these aspects of the proposal, and in particular sought possible additional examples where a consumer's material violation of the loan or open-end credit agreement may or may not warrant acceleration of the debt.", 
                        "The Bureau received two public comments from industry in response to this request, which generally requested additional guidance on the term \u201cmaterial violation of the loan agreement,\u201d and questioned whether the proposed rule would permit acceleration in circumstances other than failure to pay property taxes that may materially impair the creditor's security interest, such as the examples that exist in the commentary to current \u00a7 1026.32(d)(8). These commenters also suggested some additional examples of actions undertaken by the consumer that they believe could result in prior lien to a first mortgage being filed against the property in \u201cmaterial violation\u201d of a loan term. These examples included failure to pay property taxes; failure to pay condominium fees, homeowner association dues or assessments, or utilities; and default on another lien on the subject property. The commenters also objected to the proposal's removal of several of the existing comments to current \u00a7 1026.32(d)(8)(iii), on the ground that acceleration is justified in those situations, and is currently permitted. Specifically, the commenters objected to the removal of language in comment 32(d)(8)(iii)-2.i.E providing that a creditor may terminate and accelerate a high-cost mortgage in some instances if the consumer obligated on the credit dies. The commenters also objected to the proposal's removal of an example in comment 32(d)(8)(iii)-2.i F providing that a creditor may terminate and accelerate a high-cost mortgage if the property is taken by eminent domain.", 
                        "In the Bureau's view, section 129(l) essentially codified the substance of current \u00a7 1026.32(d)(8). The changes the Bureau proposed to \u00a7 1026.32(d)(8) and its commentary were primarily for clarity and organizational purposes. Upon further consideration and in light of the comments regarding the potential impact of removing certain examples, the Bureau has decided to implement a final rule and commentary that closely follow the current \u00a7 1026.32(d)(8) and commentary. The Bureau agrees that acceleration should not be deemed impermissible under Regulation Z in situations where it is currently permitted, and is including the examples set forth in current comments 32(d)(8)(iii)-2.i.E and F the commentary to the final rule. The Bureau believes these revisions adequately and appropriately address industry's comments by clarifying that acceleration may be permitted in certain circumstances where the creditor's security interest is materially and adversely affected, such as when an action or inaction by the consumer results in a prior lien being filed against the property, or the property is taken by eminent domain.", 
                        "The Bureau declines to include the various other examples provided by industry commenters in the commentary. The Bureau notes that the examples set forth in comment 32(d)(8)(iii)-2.i.A through G serve only as illustrations of instances where acceleration may be deemed permissible when the action or inaction by the consumer impairs the creditor's security interest. These circumstances may, but do not always, adversely affect the creditor's security interest, and the list of examples is not all-inclusive. While the Bureau agrees with industry commenters that other actions or inactions that may result in a prior lien being filed against the property could materially impair the creditor's security interest, the Bureau does not believe the examples provided, such as failure to pay homeowner association dues or utilities, are likely to result in such an impairment in most circumstances. The Bureau thus declines to include these specific examples in the commentary to \u00a7 1026.32(d)(8).", 
                        "In addition, the Bureau is adding comment 32(d)(8)(i)-1 to provide further guidance regarding acceleration of a loan for fraud or material misrepresentation, consistent with comment 40(f)(2)(i)-1 (concerning requirements for home equity plans). The Bureau believes that this guidance will be equally helpful to creditors seeking to accelerate a high-cost mortgage. Finally, the Bureau has made minor changes for clarification and in light of the expansion of the coverage of HOEPA to include open-end credit."

Therefore, the existing requirements and the presumption of compliance under \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(i)-(iv) would no longer have applied to closed-end credit transactions. Rather, as set forth in the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule, a creditor would have been required to consider specific criteria and records set forth in \u00a7 1026.43(c)(2) and (3) and, based on that criteria, make a \u201creasonable and good faith determination at or before consummation that the consumer will have a reasonable ability to repay\u201d the high-cost mortgage. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.43(c)(1) and comments 43(c)(1)-1 and 43(c)(2)-1.",

The 2012 HOEPA Proposal stated that only open-end credit transactions are subject to the \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4) ability-to-repay requirements, and thus would have removed the presumption of compliance currently available for any such high-cost mortgage under \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(iii). <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> proposed comment 34(a)(4)-1.\n             However, as also set forth in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the &#167; 1026.43(e) rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirement would have been available for certain high-cost mortgages that meet the specific qualified mortgage criteria set forth in &#167; 1026.43(e).\n            \n          ", 
                                "The Bureau solicited comment on this aspect of the proposal, and received a few public comments from consumer groups that generally supported it. In particular, consumer groups agreed that requiring creditors to comply with the ability-to-repay requirements set forth in \u00a7 1026.43 for all closed-end credit transactions, including high-cost mortgages, should benefit consumers by simplifying compliance and enforcement of the rules, provided that the final rule does not reduce the remedies available for high-cost mortgages. No commenters raised objections to this aspect of the proposal. However, as more fully discussed in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, several consumer groups submitted comments in connection with the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal requesting that high-cost mortgages be prohibited from receiving qualified mortgage status through the 2013 ATR Final Rule. Those commenters noted that high-cost mortgages have been singled out by Congress as deserving of special regulatory treatment because of their potential to be abusive to consumers, and argued that it would seem incongruous for any high-cost mortgage to be given a presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rule.", 
                                "The Bureau is adopting this aspect of \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4) as proposed, which is consistent with the statutory language of TILA section 129C. The Bureau notes that the 2013 ATR Final Rule does not prohibit a high-cost mortgage from being a qualified mortgage, but is mindful that allowing a high-cost mortgage to meet the qualified mortgage criteria set forth in \u00a7 1026.43 potentially raises concerns for consumer groups regarding HOEPA protections and remedies. However, the Bureau disagrees with consumer groups that suggest allowing certain high-cost mortgages to be \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d\u2014and thereby permitting a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the \u00a7 1026.43(a) repayment ability requirements for these transactions\u2014is incongruous with the underlying consumer protection purpose of HOEPA. Rather, the Bureau believes that the net effect of requiring creditors to comply with \u00a7 1026.43 for all closed-end transactions, including those rules that pertain to the presumption of compliance available for qualified mortgages, should be enhanced consumer protection and facilitation of compliance.", 
                                "There are several considerations informing the Bureau's treatment of repayment ability requirements. First, as discussed above, the Dodd-Frank Act does not prohibit high-cost mortgages from receiving qualified mortgage status. While the statute imposes a points and fees limit on qualified mortgages (3 percent, generally) that effectively prohibits loans that trigger the high-cost mortgage points and fee threshold from receiving qualified mortgage status, it does not impose an APR limit on qualified mortgages. Therefore, nothing in the statute prohibits a creditor from making a loan with an APR that triggers HOEPA coverage, while still meeting the criteria for a qualified mortgage.", 
                                "Second, although they are similar, the Bureau generally considers the ability-to-repay requirements set forth in \u00a7 1026.43 to be more protective of consumers than the current ability-to-repay criteria for high-cost mortgages set forth in current \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(i)-(iv). For example, \u00a7 1026.43 would require creditors to consider additional factors not currently included in \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4), such as a consumer's monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income. The Bureau generally believes these criteria to be more rigorous than the current ability-to-repay provisions.", 
                                "Third, the Bureau believes that, for high-cost mortgages that meet the qualified mortgage definition, there is reason to provide a presumption, subject to rebuttal, that the creditor had a reasonable and good faith belief in the consumer's ability to repay notwithstanding the high interest rate. High-cost mortgages will be less likely to meet qualified mortgage criteria because the higher interest rate will generate higher monthly payments and thus require higher income to satisfy the debt-to-income test for a qualified mortgage. Where that test is satisfied\u2014that is, where the consumer has an acceptable debt-to-income ratio calculated in accordance with qualified mortgage underwriting rules\u2014there is no logical reason to exclude the loan from the definition of a qualified mortgage.", 
                                "The Bureau also disagrees with the concerns raised by consumer groups that allowing a rebuttable presumption of compliance for these high-cost mortgages will undermine consumer protection. Rather, the Bureau believes the final rule will provide greater consumer protection than the current ability-to-repay rules, which allow for a presumption of compliance for any high-cost mortgages. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> current &#167; 1026.34(a)(4)(iii). As more fully set forth in the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule, for any high-cost mortgages that do not meet the qualified mortgage criteria set forth in &#167; 1026.43(e), there will be no presumption of compliance available to creditors for the &#167; 1026.34(a)(4) ability-to-repay requirement. The Bureau believes this will provide greater consumer protection and facilitate, rather than hinder, challenges to creditors' repayment ability determinations for these transactions.", 
                                "The Bureau also believes that allowing high-cost mortgages to be qualified mortgages could provide an incentive to creditors that make high-cost mortgages to satisfy the qualified mortgage requirements, which would provide additional consumer protections. For example, creditors who make high-cost mortgages as qualified mortgages will need to have verified the consumer's assets, liabilities, income and other criteria, and determined that the consumer's debt-to-income ratio meets certain specified criteria. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.43(e). Further protections and restrictions, such as restricting interest-only payments and limiting loan terms to 30 years, are not requirements under HOEPA, but are required to achieve qualified mortgage status.", 
                                "The Bureau believes that allowing high-cost, qualified mortgages may be particularly beneficial to consumers in certain small loan markets, where some creditors may need to exceed high-cost mortgage thresholds due to the unique structure of their business. The Bureau believes that these creditors are likely to make high-cost mortgages regardless of the various disincentives to high-cost lending, and allowing for a presumption of compliance for these high-cost mortgages could provide an incentive to these creditors to make these mortgages as qualified mortgages. As discussed above, the Bureau believes this would be in the interest of consumers by providing additional consumer protections.", 
                                "The Bureau also does not believe that allowing high-cost mortgages to be \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d will deprive consumers of the substantive protections or remedies afforded by HOEPA or encourage creditors to engage in high-cost lending. Other than allowing for a presumption of compliance with the \u00a7 1026.43 repayment ability requirements for those transactions that meet the criteria for qualified mortgages, the enhanced disclosure and counseling requirements, and the enhanced liability for HOEPA violations, are unaffected by the final rule.", 
                                "Finally, in addition to the various benefits to consumers described above, the Bureau believes that requiring the same standards for determining repayment ability and obtaining a rebuttable presumption of compliance for other closed-end credit transactions not covered by HOEPA and high-cost mortgages that are subject to the repayment ability requirements of \u00a7 1026.43 will facilitate compliance by providing clarity and consistency between the 2013 ATR Final Rule and the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule."

Retaining this exemption is consistent with the historical and current treatment of bridge loans under HOEPA's ability-to-repay standards, and also is consistent with the TILA section 129C(a)(8) exemption for bridge loans that apply to the general ability-to-repay requirements set forth in the 2013 ATR Final Rule. The Bureau believes this approach is in the interest of the borrowing public and will strengthen home ownership and equity protection because it will not unduly restrict access to temporary bridge financing for consumers."

To facilitate compliance, the Bureau proposed to implement TILA section 129(h) as it applies to open-end credit plans in proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4) by amending the existing mortgage repayment ability requirements in current \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4) to apply specifically to high-cost open-end credit plans. The Bureau solicited public comment on this issue, but did not receive any comments that addressed it.", 
                                "The Bureau is revising \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4) to provide, as proposed, that in connection with an open-end credit plan subject to \u00a7 1026.32, a creditor shall not open a plan for a consumer where credit is or will be extended without regard to the consumer's repayment ability as of account opening, including the consumer's current and reasonably expected income, employment, assets other than the collateral, and current obligations, including any mortgage-related obligations. As discussed above, the Bureau notes that in the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule, the Board adopted a rule prohibiting individual high-cost mortgages or higher-priced mortgage loans from being extended based on the collateral without regard to repayment ability, in place of a prior rule prohibiting a pattern or practice of making extensions based on the collateral without regard to consumers' ability to repay. The existing requirements further create a presumption of compliance under certain conditions to provide creditors with more certainty and to mitigate potential increased litigation risk.", 
                                "The Board concluded that this regulatory structure was warranted based on the comments the Board received and additional information. Specifically, the Board exercised its authority under TILA section 129(<em data-original=\"E-03\">l</em>)(2) (renumbered as TILA section 129(p)(2) by the Dodd-Frank Act) to revise the liability standard for high-cost mortgages based on a conclusion that the revisions were necessary to prevent unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with mortgage loans. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 73 FR 44545, at 44539 (July 30, 2008). In particular, the Board concluded that a prohibition on making individual loans without regard for repayment ability was necessary to ensure a remedy for consumers who are given unaffordable loans and to deter irresponsible lending. The Board determined that imposing the burden to prove &#8220;pattern or practice&#8221; on an individual consumer would leave many borrowers with a lesser remedy, such as those provided under some State laws, or without any remedy, for loans made without regard to repayment ability. The Board further determined that removing this burden would not only improve remedies for individual borrowers, it would also increase deterrence of irresponsible lending. The Board concluded that the structure of its rule would also have advantages for creditors over a &#8220;pattern or practice&#8221; standard, which can create substantial uncertainty and litigation risk. While the Board's rule removed the &#8220;pattern or practice&#8221; language from its rule, it provided certainty to creditors by including specific procedures for establishing a rebuttable presumption of compliance.", 
                                "For substantially the same reasons detailed by the Board in the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule, the Bureau believes that it is necessary and proper to use its authority under TILA section 129(p)(2) to retain the existing \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4) repayment ability requirements with respect to individual open-end credit plans that are high-cost mortgages, with a presumption of compliance as specified in the regulation, rather than merely prohibiting a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of engaging in such transactions without regard for consumers' ability to repay the loans. The Bureau believes that the concerns discussed in the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule, such as preventing unfair practices, providing remedies for individual borrowers, and providing more certainty to creditors, are equally applicable to open-end transactions that are high-cost mortgages. Furthermore, also for these same reasons, the Bureau believes it would not be in creditors' and borrowers' interest to reinsert the \u201cpattern or practice\u201d language and remove the presumption of compliance in existing \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4). Therefore, the Bureau believes that applying the existing repayment ability requirement in current \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4) to open-end high-cost mortgages is necessary to prevent unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with mortgage loans. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> TILA section 129(p)(2).", 
                                "The Bureau is also revising several aspects of \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4) for consistency with the 2013 ATR Final Rule and for clarification purposes. The Bureau is removing \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(ii)(B) and accompanying comments 34(a)(4)(ii)(B)-1 and -2, which the Bureau proposed to retain. This provision would have provided an affirmative defense for a creditor that can show that the amounts of the consumer's income or assets that the creditor relied upon in determining the consumer's repayment ability were not materially greater than the amounts the creditor could have verified using third-party records at or before consummation. The Bureau notes that the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal solicited comment on whether it should have provided this provision in the \u00a7 1026.43 repayment ability requirements which, while not specified under TILA, would have been consistent with the Board's 2008 HOEPA Final Rule. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 2011 ATR Proposal, 76 FR 27390, 27426 (May 11, 2011); <em data-original=\"E-03\">see also</em> &#167; 1026.34(a)(4)(ii)(B).",

These commenters argued that the provision would undermine the income and asset verification requirement provided in proposed \u00a7 1026.43(c)(4). Other commenters noted that providing an affirmative defense might result in confusion, and possible litigation, over what the term \u201cmaterial\u201d may mean, and that a rule permitting an affirmative defense would need to define materiality specifically, including from whose perspective materiality should be measured (<em data-original=\"E-03\">i.e.,</em> the creditor's or the consumer's).", 
                                "As discussed in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau is not adopting an affirmative defense as part of final \u00a7 1026.43 because, in the Bureau's view, such a defense could result in circumvention of the \u00a7 1026.43(c)(4) verification requirement.", 
                                "Upon further consideration of proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(ii)(B), and in light of the 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau believes that the same reasoning applies to the repayment ability requirements for open-end credit transactions. In the Bureau's view, adopting the affirmative defense set forth in proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(ii)(B) would create an unnecessary inconsistency between the repayment ability criteria in \u00a7 1026.43(c) and \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4). Further, the Bureau believes the title XIV amendments to TILA provide a strong indication that creditors should be required to verify income, assets, and other relevant information as part of the repayment ability determination. This principle is reflected in the Bureau's decision not to adopt this affirmative defense for the repayment ability requirements set forth in the 2013 ATR Final Rule. The Bureau believes that proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(ii)(B) could have encouraged some creditors to determine repayment ability for open-end credit plans without verifying a consumer's income, assets, and other relevant information. Removing proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(ii)(B), on the other hand, will better protect consumers, facilitate compliance, and better harmonize the 2013 HOEPA and ATR Final Rules. Accordingly, the Bureau is removing proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(ii)(B) and renumbering the remainder of \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(ii).", 
                                "The Bureau is also revising the definition of \u201cmortgage-related obligations\u201d to reflect the definition set forth in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, and clarifying that, with respect to open-end credit plans, \u201cmortgage-related obligations\u201d are obligations that are required by another credit obligation undertaken prior to or at account opening, and are secured by the same dwelling. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.43(b)(8). For clarity and consistency with this revised definition, the Bureau is also removing existing comment 34(a)(4)(i)-1, which had further defined the term using the previous definition.",

The Bureau is removing proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(iv)(A), which would have excluded negatively amortizing transactions from the \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4) presumption of compliance. Given that negative amortization features are prohibited altogether for high-cost mortgages, and \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(iv) only applies only to open-end, high-cost mortgages, it is unnecessary to exclude such transactions from the \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(iii) presumption of compliance. The Bureau is also revising comment 34(a)(4)-4 to reflect this change.", 
                                "The proposal generally incorporated guidance in current comments 34(a)(4)-1 through -5, with revisions for clarity and consistency. Proposed comment 34(a)(4)-1 would have clarified that the repayment ability requirement under \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4) applies to open-end credit plans subject to \u00a7 1026.32; however, the repayment ability provisions of \u00a7 1026.43 apply to closed-end credit transactions subject to \u00a7 1026.32. Proposed comment 34(a)(4)-3 also would have clarified the current commentary to conform with proposed revisions and removed the current example. Finally, proposed comment 34(a)(4)(iii)(B)-1 would have removed the examples in current comment 34(a)(4)(iii)(B) as unnecessary or inapplicable. The Bureau did not receive any comments addressing these aspects of the proposal.",

In 2008, the Board by regulation eliminated the \u201cpattern or practice\u201d requirement under the HOEPA ability-to-repay provision and also applied the repayment ability requirement to higher-priced mortgage loans. The 2008 HOEPA Rule set forth the specific requirements for verification of repayment ability in \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(ii). In addition, \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(iii) provides for a presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements if the creditor follows certain procedures. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1026.34(a)(4)(iii)-(iv) and comment 34(a)(4)(iii)-1.

The consumer can still rebut or overcome that presumption by showing that, despite following the procedures specified in &#167; 1026.34(a)(4)(iii), the creditor nonetheless disregarded the consumer's ability to repay the loan. For example, the consumer could present evidence that although the creditor assessed the consumer's debt-to-income ratio or residual income, the debt-to-income ratio was very high or the residual income was very low. This evidence may be sufficient to overcome the presumption of compliance and demonstrate that the creditor extended credit without regard to the consumer's ability to repay the loan.",

Specifically, the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule (which implements TILA section 129C) extends these new ability-to-repay requirements to any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling, except an open-end credit plan, a transaction secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan, a reverse mortgage, or temporary loans such as construction loans and bridge loans with terms of 12 months or less. Closed-end credit transactions that are high-cost mortgages, as defined in TILA section 103(bb), will be subject to the ability-to-repay requirements pursuant to TILA section 129C and the Bureau's implementing regulations at \u00a7 1026.43. Open-end credit plans secured by the consumer's principal dwelling that are high-cost mortgages will not be subject to the ability-to-pay requirements of Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule, but will instead be subject to the existing ability-to-repay requirements of TILA section 129(h) and the Bureau's implementing regulations at \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4). As discussed below, the Bureau is revising \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4) to account for these significant changes to the regulatory landscape with respect to repayment ability for closed-end credit transactions, and amending the existing repayment ability requirements in current \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4) to apply specifically to high-cost open-end credit plans."

                        "The Bureau proposed to revise current \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(iii) to clarify the criteria that a creditor must satisfy to obtain a presumption of compliance with the repayment ability requirements for high-cost mortgages that are open-end credit plans. In particular, current \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(iii)(B) requires that a creditor determine the consumer's repayment ability using the largest payment of principal and interest scheduled in the first seven years following consummation and taking into account current obligations and mortgage-related obligations. The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to determine the consumer's repayment ability based on the largest periodic payment amount a consumer would be required to pay under the payment schedule. However, applying this requirement to open-end credit plans requires additional assumptions because a creditor may not know certain factors required to determine the largest required minimum periodic payment, such as the amount a consumer will borrow and the applicable annual percentage rate. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed revised \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(iii)(B) to require a creditor to determine the consumer's repayment ability taking into account current obligations and mortgage-related obligations as defined in \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(i), and using the largest required minimum periodic payment. Furthermore, proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(4)(iii)(B) would have required a creditor to determine the largest required minimum periodic payment based on the following assumptions: (1) The consumer borrows the full credit line at account opening with no additional extensions of credit; (2) the consumer makes only required minimum periodic payments during the draw period and any repayment period; and (3) the maximum APR that may apply under the payment plan (as required to be included in the consumer credit contract under \u00a7 1026.30) applies to the plan at account opening and will apply during the draw period and any repayment period.

Prior to extending a high-cost mortgage, TILA section 129(u)(1) requires that a creditor receive certification that a consumer has obtained counseling on the advisability of the mortgage from a HUD-approved counselor, or at the discretion of HUD's Secretary, a State housing finance authority. TILA section 129(u)(1) also prohibits such a counselor from being employed by or affiliated with the creditor. TILA section 129(u)(3) specifically authorizes the Bureau to prescribe regulations that it determines are appropriate to implement the counseling requirement. In addition to the counseling requirement, TILA section 129(u)(2) requires that a counselor verify, prior to certifying that a consumer has received counseling on the advisability of the high-cost mortgage, that the consumer has received each statement required by TILA section 129 (implemented in \u00a7 1026.32(c)) or each statement required by RESPA with respect to the transaction.\n             The Bureau is exercising its authority under TILA section 129(u)(3) to implement the counseling requirement in a way that ensures that borrowers will receive meaningful counseling, and at the same time that the required counseling can be provided in a manner that minimizes operational challenges."

As described in the preamble of the proposal, this program provides counseling to consumers on a broad array of topics, including seeking, financing, maintaining, renting, and owning a home. According to HUD, the purpose of the program is to provide a broad range of housing counseling services to homeowners and tenants to assist them in improving their housing conditions and in meeting the responsibilities of tenancy or homeownership. Counselors can also help borrowers evaluate whether interest rates may be unreasonably high or repayment terms unaffordable, and thus may help reduce the risk of defaults and foreclosures.", 
                                "HUD historically has implemented its housing counseling program by issuing approvals of nonprofit agencies that meet its requirements for participation, monitoring these agencies, and awarding competitive grants to these agencies. HUD also provides counseling funds through State housing finance authorities and national and regional intermediaries, which provide oversight, support, and funding for affiliated local counseling agencies. HUD has required counseling agencies to meet various program requirements and comply with program policies and regulations to participate in HUD's housing counseling program.\n             While HUD's regulations establish training and experience requirements for the individual counselors employed by the counseling agencies, to date, HUD generally has not approved individual counselors. Pursuant to amendments made to the housing counseling statute by section 1445 of the Dodd-Frank Act, HUD must provide for the certification of individual housing counselors going forward. Section 106(e) of the Housing and Urban Development Act (12 U.S.C. 1701x(e)) provides that the standards and procedures for testing and certifying counselors must be established by regulation. The Bureau understands that HUD is undertaking a rulemaking to put these standards and procedures in place for individual counselors.",

                        "Consistent with the statute, proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(5)(i) would have prohibited a creditor from extending a high-cost mortgage unless the creditor receives written certification that the consumer has obtained counseling on the advisability of the mortgage from a HUD-approved counselor, or a State housing finance authority, if permitted by HUD.", 
                        "While a significant number of both consumer group and industry commenters expressed support for the counseling requirement for high-cost mortgages, a few commenters objected to the counseling requirement generally. Some industry commenters were concerned that consumers would view counseling as an unnecessary burden due to its cost and inconvenience, or that the requirement for counseling could cause closings to be delayed. In addition, a nonprofit network that provides training to housing counselors objected to the counseling requirement out of concern that because counseling is only being required for consumers seeking the riskiest loans, counselors will be unable to influence the performance of the loans, which could cause others to question the value of counseling unfairly. This commenter instead recommended that counseling be required for all first-time borrowers seeking anything other than a 30 year, fixed-rate mortgage with fixed payments. One commenter urged that high-cost mortgages that finance manufactured housing be exempt from the counseling requirement, because the counseling fee would constitute a disproportionately large cost for these relatively small mortgages.", 
                        "The Bureau does not believe any of these concerns warrant departing from the statutory requirement for high-cost mortgage counseling. The Bureau does not agree with commenters that the counseling for high-cost mortgages is an unnecessary burden. Congress made the determination that mandatory counseling would be beneficial to consumers prior to obtaining certain types of riskier loans, and the Bureau is not persuaded that it should use its authority to depart from that determination. Although the Bureau understands concerns that counseling could be valuable for some first-time borrowers of loans other than those that are fixed-rate and with fixed payments, the Bureau proposed to require and solicited comment on counseling consistent with the statute, and does not believe that it has a basis to determine whether the benefits of mandatory counseling outweigh the costs for a broader group of consumers. With respect to concerns about the perceived efficacy of counseling due to the limited nature of the counseling requirements, the Bureau does not agree that a counselor will be unable to influence the outcome of the mortgage. The Bureau believes that a consumer may decide not to move forward with a high-cost mortgage even after application, or may be able to shop or negotiate for different mortgage terms, based on counseling received on the advisability of the mortgage. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the requirement to provide a list of housing counselors under RESPA, discussed above, will encourage applicants for other types of mortgages to obtain homeownership counseling even if they are not required to do so. As to the requested exclusion from counseling for high-cost mortgages that finance manufactured housing, the Bureau believes that counseling would be equally beneficial to a consumer financing a manufactured home through a high-cost mortgage as it would be for a consumer financing another type of dwelling. Finally, the Bureau notes that the counseling provisions would permit the cost of counseling to be financed or to be paid by the creditor, provided that the creditor does not condition payment on the closing of the loan. For all of these reasons, the Bureau is finalizing the requirement for certification of counseling in \u00a7 1026.34(a)(5)(i) as proposed.", 
                        "The Bureau also proposed commentary addressing a number of issues related to proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(5)(i), to provide creditors additional compliance guidance. As discussed in detail below, the Bureau is also adopting this guidance as proposed, with certain revisions.", 
                        "TILA section 129(u) does not define the term \u201cState housing finance authority.\u201d Proposed comment 34(a)(5)-1 would have clarified that for the purposes of \u00a7 1026.34(a)(5), a State housing finance authority has the same meaning as a \u201cState housing finance agency\u201d provided in 24 CFR 214.3 of HUD's regulations implementing the housing counseling program. The Bureau proposed to use the definition contained in 24 CFR 214.3 because it specifically addresses the ability of State housing finance authorities to provide or fund counseling, either directly or through an affiliate. The Bureau did not receive any comment regarding this definition and is finalizing it as proposed, except that the Bureau is renumbering it as 34(a)(5)(i)-2 for organizational purposes.", 
                        "The Bureau proposed comment 34(a)(5)(i)-1 to clarify that counselors approved by the Secretary of HUD are homeownership counselors that are certified pursuant to section 106(e) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701x(e)), or as otherwise determined by the Secretary of HUD. The Bureau proposed this clarification because of its understanding that other than for its HECM counseling program, HUD currently approves housing counseling agencies and not individual counselors, but will be certifying housing counselors in the future to implement section 1445 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The proposed comment was intended to ensure that the Bureau's regulations do not impede HUD from determining which counselors qualify as HUD-approved and to account for future decisions of HUD with respect to the approval of counselors.\n             The Bureau did not receive any comments objecting to this guidance, and is adopting it as proposed.", 
                        "Proposed comment 34(a)(5)(i)-2 would have provided that prior to receiving certification of counseling, a creditor may not extend a high-cost mortgage, but may engage in other activities, such as processing an application that will result in the extension of a high-cost mortgage (by, for example, ordering an appraisal or title search). As the Bureau discussed in the preamble of the proposal, nothing in the statutory requirement restricts a creditor from processing an application that will result in the extension of a high-cost mortgage prior to obtaining certification of counseling, and permitting the processing of the application is consistent with the high-cost mortgage counseling requirements as a whole.\n\n             Moreover, the Bureau believes that proposed comment 34(a)(5)(i)-2 is necessary to address both the ability of a creditor to provide the required disclosures to the consumer to permit certification of counseling, and to address the likelihood that a creditor may receive the required certification of counseling only days before the consummation of the loan, at the earliest. As discussed in the preamble of the proposal, new TILA section 129(u)(2) requires a counselor to verify the consumer's receipt of <em data-original=\"E-03\">each</em> statement required by either TILA section 129 (which sets forth the requirement for additional disclosures for high-cost mortgages and is implemented in &#167; 1026.32(c)) or by RESPA prior to issuing certification of counseling. The additional disclosures for high-cost mortgages required under &#167; 1026.32(c) may be provided by the creditor up to three business days prior to consummation of the mortgage. RESPA requires lenders to provide borrowers several disclosures over the course of the mortgage transaction, such as the good faith estimate and the settlement statement. Currently, the HUD-1 may be provided by the creditor at settlement.\n             Commenters generally did not raise any objections to comment 34(a)(5)(i)-2, and the Bureau is finalizing it as proposed, except that it is renumbering it as 34(a)(5)(i)-3 for organizational purposes.", 
                        "Proposed comment 34(a)(5)(i)-3 would have set forth the methods whereby a certification form may be received by the creditor. The proposed comment clarifies that the written certification of counseling may be received by any method, such as mail, email, or facsimile, so long as the certification is in a retainable form. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this guidance, and except for renumbering it as 34(a)(5)(i)-4, is finalizing it as proposed.", 
                        "One counseling association requested clarification that the required certification of counseling is not an indication that a counselor has made a judgment about the appropriateness of a high-cost mortgage for a consumer. This commenter expressed its support for proposed comment 34(a)(5)(iv)-1, which similarly would have provided that a statement that a consumer has received counseling on the advisability of a high-cost mortgage does not require the counselor to have made a judgment as to the appropriateness of the high-cost mortgage, as discussed below. The Bureau agrees that it would be useful to clarify that certification of counseling is not evidence of a counselor's opinion of the loan for the consumer, but only that the consumer has received counseling. Accordingly, the Bureau has added new comment 34(a)(5)(i)-5 to address the purpose of certification in the final rule.", 
                        "A few commenters raised operational issues related to the certification process, including generally asking for more guidance and asking the Bureau to allow creditors to move forward with the consummation of a high-cost mortgage without a certification form if the counselor does not provide the form to the creditor within a certain time period. The Bureau has not proposed additional guidance related to the certification process, in part because the Bureau believes that it is important to allow flexibility so that counselors and creditors can develop processes that work best. The Bureau also declines to permit a creditor to consummate a high-cost mortgage without receiving certification of counseling, which is required by the statute. Such a result would be inconsistent with the basic statutory scheme, since absent certification, a creditor could not be certain that counseling occurred, that the counseling addressed the required elements, or that the counselor was able to verify receipt of the required disclosures."

                        "As noted above, TILA section 129(u)(1) requires that a creditor receive certification of counseling prior to extending a high-cost mortgage to a consumer, but otherwise does not address when counseling should occur. Proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(5)(ii) would have required counseling to occur after the consumer receives either the good faith estimate required under RESPA or the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.40 for open-end credit. The Bureau noted in the preamble to the proposal that permitting counseling to occur as early as possible allows consumers more time to consider whether to proceed with a high-cost mortgage and to shop or negotiate for different mortgage terms. However, the Bureau believes that it is also important that counseling on a high-cost mortgage address the specific loan terms being offered to a consumer. The Bureau therefore concluded that requiring the receipt of either of these transaction-specific documents prior to the consumer's receipt of counseling on the advisability of the high-cost mortgage would best ensure that the counseling session can address the specific features of the high-cost mortgage and that consumers will have an opportunity to ask questions about the loan terms offered. At the same time, given that these documents are provided to the consumer within a few days following application, the Bureau believes that the proposal permits counseling to occur early enough to give consumers sufficient time after counseling to consider whether to proceed with the high-cost mortgage transaction and to consider alternative options.\n            \n          ", 
                        "Despite the verification requirement, the Bureau does not believe that it would make sense to wait until receipt of all disclosures referenced in the statute to permit counseling to occur. Accordingly, nothing in proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(5)(ii) would require a counselor to wait for the receipt of either the \u00a7 1026.32(c) disclosure or the full set of RESPA disclosures that must be verified prior to certification to provide counseling. As noted above, the \u00a7 1026.32(c) high-cost mortgage disclosure is generally required to be provided to the consumer no later than three business days prior to consummation of the loan, and one of the disclosures required under RESPA, the HUD-1, currently may be provided to the consumer at settlement. As a practical matter, this means that certification would not happen until right before closing. The Bureau does not believe that delaying counseling pending receipt of all disclosures would benefit consumers, because consumers may not be able to walk away from the transaction or seek better loan terms so late in the process. Accordingly, the Bureau concluded that the best approach would be a two-stage process in which counseling would occur prior to and separately from the receipt of the high-cost mortgage disclosures, after which the counselor would confirm receipt of the disclosures, answer any additional questions from the consumer, and issue the certification. Under these circumstances, a consumer obtaining a high-cost mortgage would have at least two separate contacts with his housing counselor, the first to receive counseling on the advisability of the high-cost mortgage, and the second to verify with the counselor that the consumer has received the applicable disclosures. The Bureau noted its belief that a second contact may be beneficial to consumers because it gives consumers an opportunity to request that the counselor explain the disclosure and to raise any additional questions or concerns they have, just prior to consummation.", 
                        "Proposed comment 34(a)(5)(ii)-1 clarified that for open-end credit plans subject to \u00a7 1026.32, proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(5)(ii) permits receipt of either the good faith estimate required by RESPA or the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.40 to allow counseling to occur, because 12 CFR 1024.7(h) permits the disclosures required by \u00a7 1026.40 to be provided in lieu of a good faith estimate, in the case of an open-end credit plan.", 
                        "Proposed comment 34(a)(5)(ii)-2 clarified that counseling may occur after the consumer receives either an initial good faith estimate or a disclosure under \u00a7 1026.40, regardless of whether a revised disclosure is subsequently provided to the consumer.", 
                        "The Bureau solicited comment on the proposed timing requirements for counseling, including whether a second contact would help facilitate compliance with the requirement for certification of counseling. Most commenters were generally supportive of the timing proposed by the Bureau, and the accompanying guidance. Commenters noted that the Bureau's proposal would allow counseling to occur early in the process, but also provide counselors with the ability to view specific disclosures. A few commenters, however, expressed a view that the counseling should occur earlier in the process, <em data-original=\"E-03\">e.g.,</em> before a consumer shops for a property or a loan.", 
                        "The Bureau agrees that counseling earlier in the process may be beneficial to some consumers. However, the Bureau believes that for high-cost mortgage borrowers, it is also important that the consumer receive counseling on the terms of the mortgage the consumer is offered. The ability to view the mortgage specific disclosures will allow counselors to provide counseling that addresses the affordability of the specific loan the consumer is considering. Moreover, the Bureau notes that practically speaking, a creditor is not likely to know whether or not the consumer will be offered a high-cost mortgage prior to receiving the consumer's application. For these reasons, the Bureau is finalizing \u00a7 1026.34(a)(5)(ii) as proposed, with minor edits for clarity and consistency."

                        "The Bureau requested comment on the proposed general affiliation prohibition, the exemption provided for State housing finance authorities, and whether the Bureau should consider excepting any other entities from the general affiliation prohibition, including nonprofit counseling agencies. A number of commenters supported the general affiliation prohibition, and several commenters also supported the exemption to the affiliation prohibition for State housing finance authorities. A few commenters, including a consumer group and an association for nonprofit counseling organizations, urged the Bureau to also exempt nonprofit organizations with 501(c)(3) status from the affiliation prohibition because such entities also provide small loans for purposes such as emergency repair or foreclosure rescue that may be classified as high-cost. These commenters noted that organizations with 501(c)(3) status have a higher level of accountability than other entities.",

The Bureau does not believe that an exemption from the affiliation prohibition is necessary for State housing finance authorities, given the general exemption from HOEPA for the transactions they make. With respect to the request for an exemption for loans originated by organizations with 501(c)(3) status, the Bureau agrees that as with loans made by State housing finance authorities, such loans may be beneficial to consumers. However, the Bureau is concerned that an entity's 501(c)(3) status may not be sufficient to prevent potential abuses and that an entity could be motivated to obtain nonprofit status in order to avoid the affiliation prohibition, if it were to exempt such entities. The Bureau is aware, for example, of concerns that credit counseling organizations engaging in questionable activities have sought nonprofit status to circumvent consumer protection laws.\n             Accordingly, the Bureau declines to create an exception to the affiliation prohibition for nonprofit organizations."

Specifically, the Bureau proposed that a statement that a consumer has received counseling on the advisability of a high-cost mortgage means that the consumer has received counseling about key terms of the mortgage transaction, as set out in the disclosures provided to the consumer pursuant to RESPA or \u00a7 1026.40; the consumer's budget, including the consumer's income, assets, financial obligations, and expenses; and the affordability of the loan for the consumer. The Bureau further provided some examples of such key terms of the mortgage transaction that are included in the good faith estimate or the disclosures required under \u00a7 1026.40 that are provided to the consumer. The Bureau noted in the preamble of the proposal that requiring counseling on the high-cost mortgage to address terms of the specific high-cost mortgage transaction is consistent with both the language and purpose of the statute, and that a requirement that counseling address the consumer's budget and the affordability of the loan is appropriate, since these are factors that are relevant to the advisability of a mortgage transaction for the consumer.

                        "TILA section 129(u) does not address the payment of fees for high-cost mortgage counseling. As the Bureau discussed in the preamble of the proposal, HUD generally permits housing counselors to charge reasonable fees to consumers for counseling services, if the fees do not create a financial hardship for the consumer.\n             For most of its counseling programs, HUD also permits creditors to pay for counseling services, either through a lump sum or on a per case basis, but imposes certain requirements on this funding to minimize potential conflicts of interest. For example, HUD requires that the payment be commensurate with the services provided and be reasonable and customary for the area, the payment not violate the requirements of RESPA, and the payment and the funding relationship be disclosed to the consumer.\n             In the HECM program, however, creditor funding of counseling is prohibited. Due to concerns that counselors may not be independent of creditors and may present biased information to consumers, section 255(d)(2)(B) of the National Housing Act, as amended by section 2122 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, prohibits mortgagees from paying for HECM counseling on behalf of mortgagors.", 
                        "As noted in the preamble, the Bureau believes that counselor impartiality is essential to ensuring that counseling affords meaningful consumer protection. Without counselor impartiality, the counseling a consumer receives on the advisability of a high-cost mortgage could be of limited value. However, the Bureau is also aware of concerns that housing counseling resources are limited and that funding for counseling may not be adequate.\n             Prohibiting creditor funding of counseling may make it more difficult for counseling agencies to maintain their programs and provide services so that consumers may meet the legal requirement to receive counseling prior to obtaining a high-cost mortgage. It may also create financial hardships for borrowers of high-cost mortgages who would otherwise be obligated to pay the counseling fee upfront or finance the counseling fee.",

However, to address potential conflicts of interest, the Bureau also proposed that a creditor may not condition the payment of these fees on the consummation of the high-cost mortgage. Moreover, the Bureau proposed that if the consumer withdraws the application that would result in the extension of a high-cost mortgage after receiving counseling, a creditor may not condition payment of counseling fees on the receipt of certification from the counselor required by proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(5)(i). If a counseling agency's collection of fees were contingent upon the consummation of the mortgage, or receipt of a certification, a counselor might have an incentive to counsel a consumer to accept a loan that is not in the consumer's best interest. The Bureau recognized, however, that a creditor may wish to confirm that a counselor has provided services to a consumer, prior to paying a counseling fee. Accordingly, proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(5)(v) also would have provided that a creditor may otherwise confirm that a counselor has provided counseling to a consumer prior to paying counseling fees. The Bureau believed proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(5)(v) would help preserve the availability of counseling for high-cost mortgages, and at the same time help ensure counselor independence and prevent conflicts of interest that may otherwise arise from creditor funding of counseling.",

The proposal was intended to ensure that several options are available for the payment of any counseling fees, such as a consumer paying the fee directly to the counseling agency, the creditor paying the fee to the counseling agency, or the creditor financing the counseling fee for the consumer.",

One commenter suggested that the Bureau address the lack of funding by amending the HUD-1 settlement form to provide a line item for \u201ccounseling/education\u201d fees, to legitimize the payment of counseling fees from closing costs. As noted in the preamble of the proposal, the Bureau is aware of concerns about the adequacy of funding for counseling. The Bureau is not persuaded, however, that it should take additional measures to address this concern beyond its proposal to ensure that several options are available for the payment of counseling fees in the context of this rulemaking.

                        "Proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(6) would have implemented the prohibition on a creditor recommending that a consumer default on an existing obligation in connection with a high-cost mortgage, in new section 129(j) of TILA, which was added by section 1433(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Specifically, section 129(j) of TILA prohibits creditors from recommending or encouraging a consumer to default on an \u201cexisting loan or other debt prior to and in connection with the closing or planned closing of a high-cost mortgage that refinances all or any portion of such existing loan.\u201d The Bureau proposed to use its authority under section 129(p)(2) of TILA to extend this prohibition in proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(6) to mortgage brokers, in addition to creditors. Section 129(p)(2) provides that the \u201cBureau by regulation * * * shall prohibit acts or practices in connection with * * * refinancing of mortgage loans the Bureau finds to be associated with abusive lending practices, or that are otherwise not in the interest of the borrower.\u201d", 
                        "The proposal noted that section 129(j) prohibits a practice\u2014in connection with a refinancing\u2014that is abusive or \u201cotherwise not in the interest of the borrower\u201d whereby a creditor advises a consumer to stop making payments on an existing loan knowing that if the consumer takes that advice, the consumer will default on the existing loan. Following the creditor's advice could therefore leave the consumer with no choice but to accept a high-cost mortgage originated by that creditor, with terms that are likely less favorable to the consumer, to refinance and eliminate the default on the existing loan. As noted in the preamble of the proposed rule, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to extend the same prohibition against such creditor actions to mortgage brokers, who often have significant interaction with consumers with regard to the refinancing of mortgage loans and could have similar incentives to encourage defaults that are not in the interest of the consumer. As stated by the Board in 2008 HOEPA Final Rule, 73 FR 44522, 44529 (July 30, 2008), the exception authority under TILA section 129(p)(2) is broad, and is not limited to practices of creditors. Proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(6) therefore prohibits this practice for both creditors and mortgage brokers.\n             The Bureau received comments from a few consumer groups that supported this extension and no comments that opposed it. Therefore, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1026.34(a)(6) as proposed.", 
                        "In addition, the Bureau proposed comments to \u00a7 1026.34(a)(6), which would have clarified that whether a creditor or mortgage broker \u201crecommends or encourages\u201d a consumer to default on an existing loan depends on the relevant facts and circumstances, and provided examples. Specifically, the Bureau proposed comment 34(a)(6)-2, which explained that a creditor or mortgage broker \u201crecommends or encourages\u201d default when the creditor or mortgage broker advises the consumer to stop making payments on an existing loan \u201cknowing that the consumer's cessation of payments will cause the consumer to default on the existing loan.\u201d Proposed comment 34(a)(6)-2 also explained that a creditor or mortgage broker does not recommend or encourage default by \u201cadvis[ing] a consumer, in good faith, to stop payment on an existing loan that is intended to be paid prior to the loan entering into default by the proceeds of a high-cost mortgage upon the consummation of that high-cost mortgage, if the consummation is delayed for reasons outside the control of the creditor or mortgage broker.\u201d", 
                        "The Bureau solicited comment on the proposed examples and on additional possible examples where a creditor or mortgage broker may or may not be recommending or encouraging a consumer's default. The Bureau received a few public comments addressing proposed comment 34(a)(6)-2. For example, one consumer group suggested that the proposed discussions of \u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201cgood faith\u201d were vague and could undermine what it believed Congress intended to be a \u201cbright line\u201d prohibition on any communication that may be viewed as a recommended default. Commenters did not suggest alternative language for the Bureau to use in place of this comment, but instead urged the Bureau to strike proposed comment 34(a)(6)-2 altogether, or replace it with a general statement that any recommendation or encouragement of nonpayment violates the ban.", 
                        "The Bureau agrees with these commenters that the discussion of \u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201cgood faith\u201d in proposed comment 34(a)(6)-2 could be confusing to creditors or to consumers. However, the Bureau believes that a flat prohibition of communication between a creditor or broker and a consumer concerning the relationship between timing of the next payment due on the existing loan and the anticipated date of consummation of the new high-cost mortgage would be unnecessary and contrary to the interests of consumers. In particular, the Bureau believes that such a prohibition could result in consumers unnecessarily making payments on loans that will be paid off prior to the due date, and then needing to seek refunds after payoff. Such a result would be inefficient and contrary to the interests of consumers\u2014particularly those with limited financial resources. On the other hand, the Bureau believes permitting limited communication from the creditor or broker to inform the borrower that the anticipated consummation date of the new high-cost mortgage will occur prior to the next payment due date on an existing loan to be refinanced by the high-cost mortgage will help prevent this inefficiency and benefit consumers.", 
                        "For these reasons, the Bureau believes that operational guidance would be helpful regarding certain situations where a consumer is scheduled to refinance an existing loan through a new high-cost mortgage, and that loan is scheduled to be consummated prior to the due date for the next payment due on the consumer's existing loan. The Bureau is adopting a revised comment 34(a)(6)-2, which addresses these concerns. Revised comment 34(a)(6)-2 removes the references to \u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201cgood faith\u201d and instead provides that a creditor or mortgage broker \u201crecommends or encourages\u201d default when the creditor or mortgage broker advises the consumer to stop making payments on an existing loan in a manner that is likely to cause the consumer to default on the existing loan. The Bureau believes that this language will alleviate the consumer protection concerns raised by commenters without unnecessarily restricting communication between a borrower and a creditor or broker.", 
                        "Revised comment 34(a)(6)-2 further provides operational guidance on certain instances where delay of consummation of a high-cost mortgage occurs for reasons outside the control of a creditor or mortgage broker. In those circumstances, revised comment 34(a)(6)-2 provides that a creditor or mortgage broker does not \u201crecommend or encourage\u201d default because the creditor or mortgage broker informs a consumer that the new high-cost mortgage is scheduled to be consummated prior to the due date for the next payment due on the consumer's existing loan (which is intended to be paid by the proceeds of the new high-cost mortgage) so long as the creditor or broker also informs the consumer that any delay of consummation of the new high-cost mortgage beyond the payment due date of the existing loan will not relieve the consumer of the obligation to make timely payment on that loan. For the reasons set forth above, the Bureau believes these revisions also address the consumer protection concerns raised by commenters without unnecessarily restricting communication between a borrower and a creditor or broker."

Specifically, section 129(s) of TILA prohibits a \u201ccreditor, successor in interest, assignee, or any agent\u201d of these parties from charging a consumer \u201cany fee to modify, renew, extend, or amend a high-cost mortgage, or to defer any payment due under the terms of such mortgage.\u201d As proposed, \u00a7 1026.34(a)(7) would have closely followed the statutory language in its implementation of section 129(s).", 
                        "The Bureau sought comment on the applicability of the prohibition to a refinancing of a high-cost mortgage, including where the refinancing would place the consumer in a non-high-cost mortgage. The Bureau also sought comment on the specific circumstances, including examples, under which the prohibition on modification and deferral fees is particularly needed to protect consumers. The Bureau further sought information on the implications of the Bureau's proposal on practices for open-end credit, and specifically on the extent to which fees are charged for a consumer's renewal or extension of the draw period under such open-end credit plans.", 
                        "The Bureau received no public comments regarding the application of this proposal to open-end credit and fees for renewal or extension of draw periods. The Bureau received comments from several consumer groups expressing support for the prohibition. Consumer advocates also urged the Bureau to clarify that the prohibition covers certain practices, including forbearances and conditioning a modification on a consumer paying a portion of the amount in arrears. Industry commenters, including community banks, voiced general opposition to the prohibition on the basis that loan modifications and deferrals involve administrative costs for the lender and the prohibition on charging consumers for them will lead to increased costs for all consumers. One commenter suggested that the prohibition may discourage lenders from offering modifications or deferrals, and several suggested that it would discourage lenders from making high-cost mortgages at all. Other industry commenters sought clarification on the specific types of fees and charges covered by the rule.", 
                        "The Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1026.34(a)(7) as proposed.

The statute specifically prohibits \u201cany fee to modify, renew, extend, or amend a high-cost mortgage\u201d or \u201cto defer any payment due under the terms of such mortgage.\u201d The Bureau thus believes that the language of section 129(s) is sufficiently broad to include forbearances and that further clarifying commentary is unnecessary. In addition, the Bureau recognizes that industry commenters argued that proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(7) may lead to increased costs. However, industry's general concerns do not provide an adequate basis to alter the unequivocal prohibition on modification and deferral fees set forth in the statute. Accordingly, the Bureau will adopt proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(7) as proposed."

                        "Section 1433 of the Dodd-Frank Act added to TILA a new section 129(m) prohibiting the direct or indirect financing of (1) any points and fees; and (2) any prepayment penalty payable by the consumer in a refinancing transaction if the creditor or an affiliate of the creditor is the holder of the note being refinanced. Proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(10) would have implemented new TILA section 129(m).", 
                        "Proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(10) would have implemented all aspects of the statute, except that the Bureau omitted the statutory language concerning the financing of prepayment penalties payable by the consumer in a refinancing transaction. The Bureau noted that such penalties are subsumed in the definition of points and fees for \u00a7 1026.32 in proposed \u00a7\u00a7 1026.32(b)(1)(vi) and (3)(iv). Thus, the prohibition against financing of \u201cpoints and fees\u201d necessarily captures the prohibition against financing of prepayment penalties payable in a refinancing transaction if the creditor or an affiliate of the creditor is the holder of the note being refinanced. Consistent with amended TILA section 103(bb)(4)(D) concerning the financing of credit insurance premiums (which new TILA section 129C(d) generally bans), proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(10) would have specified that credit insurance premiums are not considered financed when they are calculated and paid in full on a monthly basis.", 
                        "Proposed comment 34(a)(10)-1 would have clarified that \u201cpoints and fees\u201d for proposed \u00a7 1026.34(a)(10) means those items that are required to be included in the calculation of points and fees under \u00a7\u00a7 1026.32(b)(1) through (5). Proposed comment 34(a)(10)-1 specified that, for example, in connection with the extension of credit under a high-cost mortgage, a creditor may finance a fee charged in connection with the consumer's receipt of pre-loan counseling under \u00a7 1026.34(a)(5) because such a fee would be excluded from points and fees as a bona fide third-party charge.", 
                        "Proposed comment 34(a)(10)-2 would have provided examples of prohibited financing of points and fees. The proposed comment explained that a creditor directly or indirectly finances points and fees in connection with a high-cost mortgage if, for example, such points or fees are added to the loan balance or financed through a separate note, if the note is payable to the creditor or to an affiliate of the creditor. In the case of an open-end credit plan, a creditor also finances points and fees if the creditor advances funds from the credit line to cover the fees.", 
                        "The Bureau requested comment on its proposed implementation of new TILA section 129(m). In particular, the Bureau requested comment on whether \u00a7 1026.34(a)(10) should prohibit the financing of charges that are not included in the calculation of points and fees, such as bona-fide third party charges (including certain amounts of private mortgage insurance premiums).", 
                        "One commenter responded to the request for comments regarding whether to include bona-fide third party charges in the financing prohibition; the comment advised against it on the basis that it risked restricting access to credit. The Bureau also received comments from industry generally objecting to the prohibition on financing of points and fees. In particular, these commenters argued that the prohibition would restrict access to credit for low-income consumers without sufficient cash to pay up-front points and fees.", 
                        "Though the Bureau acknowledges industry's concern regarding low-income borrowers' ability to pay up-front points and fees, it does not believe this provides a sufficient basis to alter the prohibition set forth in the statute. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the prohibition provides enhanced consumer protection because it will prohibit creditors from imposing excessive points and fees in connection with high-cost mortgages by rolling them into the loan balance. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting \u00a7 1026.34(a)(10) and comments 34(a)(10)-1 and 34(a)(10)-2 as proposed."

Section 129(r) of TILA specifically prohibits a creditor from taking \u201cany action in connection with a high-cost mortgage\u201d to: (1) \u201cStructure a loan as an open-end credit plan or another form of loan for the purpose and with the intent of evading the provisions of this title,\u201d which include the high-cost mortgage requirements; or (2) divide a loan into separate parts \u201cfor the purpose and with the intent\u201d to evade the same provisions.", 
                        "Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, open-end credit plans were not within the scope of HOEPA's coverage. Current \u00a7 1026.34(b) prohibits structuring a home-secured loan as an open-end plan to evade the requirements of HOEPA. The Dodd-Frank Act amended TILA, however, to include open-end credit plans within the scope of coverage of HOEPA. Nevertheless, as noted, new section 129(r) prohibits the structuring of what would otherwise be a high-cost mortgage in the form of an open-end credit plan, or another form of loan, including dividing the loan into separate parts. Proposed \u00a7 1026.34(b) would have implemented this new section by prohibiting the structuring of a transaction that is otherwise a high-cost mortgage as another form of loan, including dividing any loan transaction into separate parts, for the purpose and intent to evade the requirements of HOEPA.", 
                        "Proposed comment 34(b)-1 would have provided examples of violations of proposed \u00a7 1026.34(b): (1) A loan that has been divided into two separate loans, thereby dividing the points and fees for each loan so that the HOEPA thresholds are not met, with the specific intent to evade the requirements of HOEPA; and (2) the structuring of a high-cost mortgage as an open-end home-equity line of credit that is in fact a closed-end home-equity loan to evade the requirement to include loan originator compensation in points and fees for closed-end credit transactions under proposed \u00a7 1026.32(b)(1).", 
                        "The proposal renumbered existing comment 34(b)-1 as comment 34(b)-2 for organizational purposes. Notwithstanding the Dodd-Frank Act's expansion of coverage under HOEPA to include open-end credit plans, the Bureau believed that the guidance set forth in proposed comment 34(b)-2 would be useful for situations where it appears that a closed-end credit transaction has been structured as an open-end credit plan to evade the closed-end HOEPA coverage thresholds. The Bureau proposed certain conforming amendments to proposed comment 34(b)-2, however, for consistency with the Bureau's proposed amendment to the definition of \u201ctotal loan amount\u201d for closed-end mortgage loans. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> the section-by-section analysis to proposed &#167; 1026.32(b)(6)(i), above.", 
                        "The Bureau received several comments from consumer groups encouraging an expansive interpretation of the new section 129(r). One specifically suggested additional requirements that all loans that have been divided into two or more loans should be evaluated to determine if they should be considered covered by HOEPA and that all open-end loans should be evaluated in the same manner as closed-end loans if they meet certain criteria. Several commenters also expressed concern over loan terms, such as rate increase after default and \u201cperformance based\u201d rates that would allow a creditor to disclose an unrealistically low APR and avoid the high-cost mortgage requirements. Consumer advocates also described a practice in which a creditor extends to a consumer an initial, unsecured loan, the proceeds of which are used to pay points and fees associated with a subsequent mortgage loan. The Bureau considered these suggestions. With respect to the comments regarding the scope of the prohibition, the Bureau believes that the proposed language is sufficiently broad to cover loans structured to evade high-cost mortgage requirements. Other provisions in Regulation Z address APR determination and disclosure, and increased interest rates after default are impermissible under \u00a7 1026.32(d)(4). In response to the comment describing the practice of making an initial, unsecured loan, the proceeds of which are used to pay points and fees associated with a subsequent mortgage loan, the Bureau has slightly revised comment 34(b)-1.i to reflect that if a creditor structures a loan as two or more loans to evade HOEPA, those loans may constitute an evasion whether made consecutively or at the same time.", 
                        "The Bureau also received comments from GSEs expressing concern regarding the ability of secondary market purchasers to determine whether a loan has been divided into one or more parts to evade high-cost mortgage requirements. Specifically, these commenters argued that, if an entity purchases only first-lien loans, it does not routinely receive documentation regarding subordinate loans and may have difficulty in uncovering evasion. Particular concern was noted that GSEs are unable to discern a creditor's \u201cintent\u201d in making a given loan. The GSE commenters thus requested a rule limiting liability for assignees when they purchase only one obligation.", 
                        "The Bureau notes the GSEs' concern, but is adopting \u00a7 1026.34(b) as proposed. The Bureau recognizes that the expansion of HOEPA coverage to include purchase-money transactions may increase the risk of assignee liability for GSEs and other secondary market purchasers. However, the Bureau does not believe this concern warrants departure from the statute. Since HOEPA's inception, TILA has provided for assignee liability with respect to all claims and defenses the consumer could assert against the creditor unless the assignee could demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201ca reasonable person exercising due diligence\u201d could not determine the loan at issue was a high-cost mortgage. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 15 U.S.C. 1641(c). The Dodd-Frank Act did not alter this long-standing provision, but did, however, add the prohibition against dividing a transaction into separate parts for the purpose and with the intent of evading HOEPA. The Bureau thus believes that interpreting TILA section 129(r) to limit liability for GSE purchasers would be inconsistent with Congress's intent to impose a special assignee liability rule for high-cost mortgage.", 
                        "In addition, the Bureau is not convinced that the GSEs will be unable to adequately control for risk of purchasing mortgages structured to evade HOEPA. While the GSEs raised concerns regarding increased risk of assignee liability, they also noted that creditors are currently required to identify loans with subordinate financing at the time of sale, and must represent and warrant that the subordinate lien loans comply with GSE requirements. In addition, they stated that GSEs are able to request additional documentation for subordinate liens. The Bureau believes these comments indicate that GSEs possess at least some capability to control for risk of purchasing loans that may have been structured to evade HOEPA through their own due diligence.", 
                        "With respect to the GSEs' claim that there is no way for them to determine whether the creditor's \u201cintent\u201d was to evade HOEPA, the Bureau is providing comment 34(b)-1i. to provide guidance on when loans may be deemed structured with the intent to evade HOEPA. Comment 34(b)-1i. provides that a creditor structures a transaction to evade HOEPA if, for example, the creditor structures a loan that would otherwise be a high-cost mortgage as two or more loans, whether made consecutively or at the same time, to divide the loan fees to avoid the points and fees threshold for high-cost mortgages.", 
                        "Finally, the final rule incorporates several additional changes. Because of changes to requirements regarding points and fees calculations for open- and closed-end transactions, the final rule removes proposed comment 34(b)-1.ii as unnecessary. In light of the Bureau's decision to create an exemption from HOEPA coverage for transactions to finance the initial construction of a dwelling, the Bureau is substituting a different comment 34(b)-1.ii to clarify that a creditor does not structure a transaction in violation of \u00a7 1026.34(b) when a loan to finance the initial construction of a dwelling may be permanently financed by the same creditor, such as a \u201cconstruction-to-permanent\u201d loan, and the construction phase and the permanent phase are treated as separate transactions. The final rule adopts the other parts of \u00a7 1026.34(b) and related commentary as proposed."

The first, found in new TILA 129C(f)(1), requires creditors to provide consumers with a disclosure that, among other things, describes negative amortization and states that negative amortization increases the outstanding principal balance of the account and reduces a consumer's equity in the property. The Bureau is not implementing this requirement in the current rule, but is planning to implement it as part of its 2012 TILA-RESPA proposal. The second provision, found in new TILA 129C(f)(2), requires creditors to obtain sufficient documentation demonstrating that a first-time borrower has received homeownership counseling from a HUD-certified organization or counselor, prior to extending credit in connection with a residential mortgage loan that may result in negative amortization. As noted in the preamble of the proposed HOEPA rule, because of the similarity of TILA 129C(f)(2) to the counseling requirement for high-cost mortgages, the Bureau is including the implementation of this counseling provision as part of this rule.",

Proposed \u00a7 1026.36(k)(3) would have addressed steering by creditors to particular counselors or counseling organizations and proposed \u00a7 1026.36(k)(4) would have required the provision of a list of counselors to consumers. In addition to requesting comments on specific aspects of the counseling requirement for negative amortization loans, the Bureau requested comment on whether it would minimize compliance burdens if the Bureau conformed the counseling requirements for mortgages that may result in negative amortization with the counseling requirements for high-cost mortgages, despite differences in statutory language.

                        "The Bureau solicited comment on the proposed general requirement and accompanying comments. A significant number of consumer groups strongly objected to the proposed counseling requirement for first-time borrowers of negative amortization loans as inadequate. These commenters noted that negative amortization loans are very high-risk and difficult for consumers to understand. Commenters asked the Bureau to ban negative amortization loans entirely, or at least to ban negative amortization loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. Alternatively, commenters asked the Bureau to require counseling for all borrowers of negative amortization loans, rather than just first-time borrowers. Some commenters also requested that the Bureau set further standards for negative amortization counseling, such as requiring the counseling to include review of loan terms and household finances. A few commenters asked the Bureau to ban negative amortization specifically for high-cost mortgages.", 
                        "The Bureau is finalizing \u00a7 1026.36(k)(1) as proposed. While the Bureau agrees that negative amortization loans are inherently more risky than fully amortizing loans, the Bureau also notes that Congress considered the risks associated with these loans, but did not ban these loans in connection with the comprehensive mortgage reforms contained in title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act. Instead, Congress has made the determination to address the increased risk associated with these mortgages by other means, such as requiring additional disclosures and counseling for first-time borrowers, and preventing loans containing negative amortization from being qualified mortgages. The Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to ban negative amortization loans more broadly in the context of this rulemaking to implement section 1414. At this time, the Bureau does not believe it is necessary to set any further standards for negative amortization counseling, beyond those in the proposal. As noted above, the Bureau proposed that the required counseling must address the risks and consequences of negative amortization, and the Bureau is now adopting that additional requirement in this final rule. Finally, in response to comments asking the Bureau to ban negative amortization for high-cost mortgages, the Bureau notes that high-cost mortgages are already prohibited from negatively amortizing, pursuant to \u00a7 1026.32(d)(2)."

However, as with the parallel requirement related to high-cost mortgages, the Bureau is not finalizing this requirement because it will essentially duplicate the counseling list requirement finalized in \u00a7 1024.20, which will require a counseling list to be provided to all applicants of federally related mortgage loans, including negative amortization mortgages."
