        "91":"<em data-original=\"E-03\">See,</em> Model Forms A-30 through A-35 and A-38 through A-40.",
        "92":"<em data-original=\"E-03\">See,</em> Model Forms A-31, A-32, A-34, A-35, A-39, and A-40.",
        "86":"12 CFR 1005.18.",
        "93":"<em data-original=\"E-03\">See,</em> Model Forms A-31, A-32, A-34, A-35, A-39, and A-40.",
        "90":"These changes were also made to Model Forms A-31, A-32, A-34, and A-35 where the language in Model Form A-37 is used. The changes are also reflected in the Spanish language disclosures.",
        "94":"One of the stylistic changes made to the Spanish language model forms was to change the format for the dates to eliminate possible consumer confusion as to the day, the month, and the year. Similar changes have been made to the English language model forms for consistency.",
        "77":"Regulation E contains some guidance on whether a card, code, or other device is \u201cmarketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate\u201d or \u201cmarketed to the general public\u201d for purposes of the requirements pertaining to gift cards. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> comments 20(b)(2)-2, 20(b)(2)-3, and 20(b)(4)-1. However, that guidance focuses on a narrow set of circumstances and does not address more broadly what actions generally constitute advertising, soliciting, or marketing.",
        "76":"Due to a scrivener's error, \u00a7 205.31(b)(vi) in the proposed rule had stated that these fees and taxes must be disclosed using the term \u201cOther <em data-original=\"E-03\">Transfer</em> Fees,&#8221; &#8220;Other <em data-original=\"E-03\">Transfer</em> Taxes,&#8221; or &#8220;Other <em data-original=\"E-03\">Transfer</em> Fees and Taxes,&#8221; or a substantially similar term (emphasis added). The model forms as proposed, however, used the term &#8220;Other Fees and Taxes.&#8221; The terms set forth in &#167; 1005.31(b)(vi) are adopted without the word &#8220;transfer&#8221; in order to more concisely describe the fees and taxes required to be disclosed in &#167; 1005.31(b)(vi). The terms used in the final rule conform to the language used in the model forms, which participants in consumer testing generally understood to mean fees and taxes charged by a person other than the provider.",
        "88":"Proposed Model Forms A-33 through A-35 and proposed Model Form A-37 were variations of the forms that were developed in consumer testing. Proposed Model Forms A-38 through A-40 were Spanish translations of proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-32. The language in the long form error resolution and cancellation notice in proposed Model Form A-36, and its Spanish translation in Model Form A-41, were based on the model form for error resolution in Regulation E. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 12 CFR part 1005, Appendix A to part 1005, Form A-3.",
        "89":"As noted above, this cancellation language may be amended to the extent \u00a7 1005.36(c) applies.",
        "73":"The Bureau notes that it has issued a separate notice of request for information in which the Bureau requests comment on whether it should revise these threshold numbers in Regulation Z. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 76 FR 75825 (Dec. 5, 2011).",
        "84":"As discussed in the proposal, such accounts need not be accounts held by a financial institution so long as the recipient may access the transferred funds without any restrictions regarding the use of such funds. For example, some Internet-based providers may track consumer funds in a virtual account or wallet and permit the holder of the account or wallet to make purchases or withdraw funds once funds are credited to the account or wallet.",
        "67":"The term \u201cState\u201d is defined in 12 CFR 1005.2(l).",
        "82":"<em data-original=\"E-03\">See also</em> EFTA section 919(g)(1) (providing that a designated recipient &#8220;shall not be deemed to be a consumer for purposes of this Act&#8221;).",
        "83":"The 30-minute cancellation period is the same time period as the remittance transfer cancellation period under Texas law. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> TX Admin. Code &#167; 278.052, which provides that a consumer may cancel a transfer for any reason within 30 minutes of initiating the transfer provided the customer has not left the premises. Unlike the Texas law, under &#167; 1005.34(a), a sender may cancel within 30 minutes, regardless of whether the sender has left the premises.",
        "80":"<em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> 76 FR 29923.",
        "81":"<em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1005.11(b). Although a financial institution may request that a consumer assert the error in writing, a consumer's failure to do so does not cancel the error resolution process, but gives the financial institution 45 days to investigate the error without having to provide provisional credit. <em data-original=\"E-03\">See</em> &#167; 1005.11(b)(2) and (c)(2).",
        "85":"<em data-original=\"E-03\">See also</em> &#167; 1005.30(a), which defines the term &#8220;agent&#8221; for purposes of the rule.",
        "87":"Some foreign exchange rates are set by monetary authorities. There are a variety of business models that providers use to fund transfers that are received in foreign currency. The timing of when foreign currency is purchased, the role of the provider in such a purchase, and the role of other intermediaries, partners, agents, and other parties can vary.",
        "79":"A complete discussion of the Board's findings is available at 76 FR at 29924-29927.",
        "78":"As discussed below, the Board performed an analysis in the proposed rule consistent with EFTA section 904(a)(2), as it existed prior to any amendments in the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 904(a)(2), however, did not apply and was not amended by the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to the Bureau. Regardless, the Board's analysis from the proposal is unchanged, and the Bureau concurs with the Board's analysis."
