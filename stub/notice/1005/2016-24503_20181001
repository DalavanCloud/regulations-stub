                "The Bureau proposed, in general, a nine month effective date for its rulemaking on prepaid accounts, with an additional three months for certain disclosure-related obligations. Comments regarding the proposed effective date generally are discussed in the detail in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(h) above and in part VI below.",
                "With regard to application of the proposed effective date to the requirements of \u00a7\u20091005.19 in particular, the Bureau received comments from several industry and trade association commenters, arguing that nine months would be insufficient to make the proposed changes. Several commenters expressed concern that issuers would need additional time to comply with the proposed submission and posting requirements pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(b) and (c), respectively, to implement the necessary system and operational changes. These commenters explained that submitting and posting prepaid account agreements would require issuers to develop a process of maintaining inventory for the agreements, create a process to update them on a quarterly basis, and develop a periodic monitoring process to ensure accuracy of these agreements. In addition, these commenters explained that the posting requirement would also require issuers to create a location on their Web sites for the posting of agreements.",
                "The Bureau is adopting an effective date of October 1, 2017 for this final rule generally, which is reflected in new \u00a7\u20091005.19(f)(1), which states that except as provided in new \u00a7\u20091005.19(f)(2), the requirements of final \u00a7\u20091005.19 apply to prepaid accounts beginning on October 1, 2017.",
                "The Bureau is adopting new \u00a7\u20091005.19(f)(2) to establish a delayed effective date of October 1, 2018 for the requirement to submit prepaid account agreements to the Bureau on a rolling basis pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b). An issuer must submit to the Bureau no later than October 31, 2018 all prepaid account agreements it offers as of October 1, 2018. The Bureau continues to work to develop a streamlined electronic submission process, which it expects will be fully operational before final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b) becomes effective on October 1, 2018. The Bureau expects to provide technical specifications regarding the electronic submission process in advance of that date. Issuers will have no submission obligations under this provision until the Bureau has issued technical specifications addressing the form and manner for submission of agreements.",

After October 1, 2018, issuers must submit on prepaid account agreements or notifications of withdrawn agreements to the Bureau within 30 days after offering, amending, or ceasing to offer the agreements.",
                "The Bureau is also adopting new comment 19(f)-2 to explain that, during the delayed agreement submission period set forth in new \u00a7\u20091005.19(f)(2), an issuer must post agreements on its Web site as required by final \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) and (d)(1)(i) using the agreements it would have otherwise submitted to the Bureau under final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b) and must provide a copy of the consumer's agreement to the consumer upon request pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.19(d)(1)(ii). For purposes of \u00a7\u20091005.19(c)(2) and (d)(2), agreements posted by an issuer on its Web site must conform to the form and content requirements set forth in final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(6). For purposes of final \u00a7\u20091005.19(c)(3) and (d)(2)(v), amended agreements must be posted to the issuer's Web site no later than 30 days after the change becomes effective as required by final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(2).",

The Bureau intends to publish a notice in the Federal Register to inform issuers when its streamlined electronic submission process is operational in order to on-board all issuers in advance of the October 1, 2018 effective date.",
                "The Bureau reminds credit card issuers that while final \u00a7\u20091005.19(h) provides a delayed effective date of October 1, 2018 to submit prepaid account agreements to the Bureau, the requirement to submit credit card agreements under Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.58 for covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan becomes effective with the rest of this final rule on October 1, 2017."

Because TILA section 122(d) specifies that a credit card issuer must provide access to cardholder agreements on the issuer's Web site, the Board did not believe that the requirements of the E-Sign Act applied to the regulations now contained at Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.58.\n             The Bureau proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(e) for ease of administration of these requirements and for consistency with Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.58(f).",

Agreements posted pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) would have been required to be accurate and updated whenever changes are made. Agreements would have been required to be placed in a location that is prominent and readily accessible by the public and without submission of personally identifiable information.",
                        "Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.58(d)(1) requires credit card issuers to update the agreements posted on their Web sites at least as frequently as the quarterly schedule required for submission of agreements to the Bureau, but permits an issuer to update its agreements more frequently if it so chooses. For Regulation Z, the Board considered a consumer group comment requesting that the online agreement be updated within a specific period of time no greater than 72 hours. The Board declined to adopt such a requirement because it believed that the burden to card issuers of updating agreements in such a short time would outweigh the benefit. In addition, the Board noted that if a consumer applies or is solicited for a credit card, the consumer will receive the updated disclosure under existing rules in Regulation Z subpart B.\n             The Bureau believed that prepaid account issuers generally update their agreements posted online as changes are made. The Bureau did not believe that prepaid account issuers would face the same burdens as credit card issuers in updating prepaid account agreements posted online because the terms of such agreements do not vary in the same manner as credit card agreement terms, which may offer a variety of rates and fees depending on the creditworthiness of the consumer. Thus, for prepaid account agreements, the Bureau proposed in \u00a7\u20091005.19(c)(3) that prepaid account agreements posted only be accurate and that issuers update their agreements whenever changes are made.",
                        "Proposed comment 19(c)-1 would have explained that an issuer's obligation to post and maintain prepaid account agreements on its Web site pursuant to proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) is distinct from that of \u00a7\u20091005.7, which requires an issuer to provide certain disclosures at the time a consumer contracts for an EFT service or before the first EFT is made involving the consumer's account, as well as the change-in-terms notice required under \u00a7\u20091005.8(a). This requirement would have also been distinct from that of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii), which would have required issuers to make the long form disclosure available to consumers prior to prepaid account acquisition and which, depending on the methods an issuer offers prepaid accounts to consumers, would have required posting of the long form disclosure on the issuer's Web site. If, for example, an issuer is not required to submit any agreements to the Bureau because the issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception under proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(4), the issuer would not have been required to post and maintain any agreements on its Web site under proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c). The issuer would have still been required to provide each individual consumer with access to his or her specific prepaid account agreement under proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(d), discussed below, by posting and maintaining the agreement on the issuer's Web site or by providing a copy of the agreement upon the consumer's request. The issuer may have also been required to post the long form disclosure required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii) online as well, depending on the methods by which the issuer offers prepaid accounts to consumers.",
                        "Proposed comment 19(c)-2 would have explained that if an issuer provides consumers with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as balance information or copies of statements, through a third-party Web site, the issuer would have been considered to maintain that Web site for purposes of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19. Such a third-party Web site would have been deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, consumers with prepaid accounts from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. Therefore, issuers that provide consumers with access to account-specific information through a third-party Web site would have been able to comply with proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) by ensuring that the agreements the issuer submits to the Bureau are posted on the third-party Web site in accordance with proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c).\n          ",

Specifically, the Bureau did not propose an equivalent to the provision addressing the Web site to be used for posting private label credit card agreements in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.58(d)(1) as well as Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.58(d)(4) requiring quarterly updates of credit card agreements posted on card issuers' Web sites, as discussed above. Proposed comment 19(c)-1 was similar to Regulation Z comment 58(d)-1, although the Bureau had modified it to distinguish the requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) from other disclosure-related obligations in Regulation E. Proposed comment 19(c)-2 would have mirrored Regulation Z comment 58(d)-2, although the Bureau had modified both it and proposed comment 19(c)-1 to remove the portions discussing the private label credit card exception. An equivalent to Regulation Z comment 58(d)-3, regarding private label credit card plans, was likewise omitted."

These commenters explained that the proposed requirement would be problematic for issuers as they would have to constantly update their Web site with new and revised agreements. One of the credit unions argued that the requirement would be an intrusion into its business practices, but also stated that issuers already post agreements online without direction from the Bureau. Several commenters expressed concern that the version of an agreement on the Bureau's Web site might differ from the version on the issuer's Web site, causing consumer confusion.",
                        "Furthermore, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.19(a)(8) above, several industry commenters, including issuing banks, industry trade associations, program managers, a think tank, and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, urged the Bureau to exclude agreements that are not offered to the public (such as payroll card, government benefit, and campus card accounts) from the requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) to post agreements to the issuer's publicly available Web site. These commenters explained that for these types of accounts, an issuer could have thousands of agreements that have been negotiated between the issuer and a third party (such as an employer, a government agency, or a university) and that are often tailored to fit the needs of individual programs. These commenters stated that such volume and variety would clutter the issuer's Web site, overwhelm consumers, and cause confusion because consumers might not understand which agreement applies to their account or why the terms differ. These commenters stated that even if consumers could navigate the volume of agreements, the third party\u2014not the consumers\u2014chooses these agreements, so comparison shopping would not be an option. In addition, these commenters stated that the public posting of these agreements raises confidentiality concerns regarding the disclosure of proprietary account features, which would compromise the issuer's ability to negotiate customized account agreements. These commenters also argued that a public posting requirement would undermine competition because it would inhibit the incentive for companies to develop novel products.",
                        "Several consumer groups and the office of a State Attorney General supported a requirement to post all agreements, including agreements that are not offered to the public, on the issuer's public Web site because they believed it would encourage competition and transparency, which they stated would help lower fees, and facilitate comparison shopping, which they stated would result in better informed consumer decisions. One consumer group argued that the public posting of agreements would assist the Bureau, researchers, and consumer advocates in compiling information to issue reports and shed light on inappropriate practices by some market participants.",
                        "With respect to publicly posting agreements that are not offered to the public, one consumer group explained that the payroll card market, in particular, is secretive and issuers and employers in this market do not generally provide fee schedules when asked. This commenter added that when it began issuing reports on unemployment compensation cards, fees started to come down. This commenter also argued that employers, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and other entities considering a prepaid card program would be able to see and compare the various terms offered in the market. This commenter further argued that, while payroll card issuers may have confidentiality clauses in their contracts with employers, those clauses do not bind employees because once the card is issued to an employee, the agreement is no longer confidential. Finally, the office of a State Attorney General argued that even though consumers who enroll in payroll card programs are not typically able to comparison shop because the employer selects their program, they would still be able to compare their plan with wage other payment options, such as a checking account, direct deposit, and other prepaid accounts.",
                        "Regarding whether the Bureau should specify a timeframe for updating agreements posted on the issuer's Web site, one credit union requested that the Bureau not designate a timeframe, and one consumer group requested that the Bureau require issuers to post agreements within seven business days of issuing the agreement."

The Bureau has revised \u00a7\u20091005.19(c)(1) to exclude prepaid account agreements that are not offered to the general public from the requirement that issuers post agreements to their publicly available Web sites. In addition, the Bureau has revised \u00a7\u20091005.19(c)(3) to clarify that an issuer must post on its publicly available Web site and update the posted agreements as frequently as the issuer is required to submit new and amended agreements to the Bureau pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.19(b). The Bureau has also made several minor revisions for clarity and consistency.",
                        "The Bureau continues to believe that the general requirement to post prepaid account agreements on the issuer's publicly available Web site will increase transparency in the terms of these agreements and the amounts of the fees assessed against the prepaid accounts. The increased transparency will allow the public and consumers to become better informed about these accounts, which will likely encourage competition and improve fees in the various markets. Furthermore, the public posting of agreements will allow consumers to compare the terms and fees among various agreements. In addition, the Bureau does not believe this general requirement will be problematic for issuers, as posting agreements on the issuer's Web site is consistent with industry practice today.",
                        "The Bureau is persuaded, however, that posting to the issuer's publicly available Web site agreements that are not offered to the general public may impose unnecessary administrative burden and have little consumer benefit. The Bureau understands that issuers of payroll card, government benefit, campus card, and other types of accounts whose agreements are not offered to the general public could potentially have thousands of agreements to post and maintain on their publicly available Web sites, which could take a considerable amount of time and resources to set up and maintain without necessarily being easy for consumers to navigate. In addition, the Bureau believes that consumers who use these types of accounts would not likely visit the issuer's general Web site to access their individual agreements. The Bureau notes that issuers of these accounts are still required to provide each individual consumer with access to his or her specific prepaid account agreement under \u00a7\u20091005.19(d), discussed below, and to submit the agreements to the Bureau under \u00a7\u20091005.19(b) (unless the de minimis exception under final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(4) or the product testing exception under final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(5) applies). In contrast, the Bureau believes that there are benefits to consumers and third parties in having agreements not available to the general public posted all in one place on the Bureau's Web site. See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.19(a)(8) above.",
                        "The Bureau is finalizing comments 19(c)-1 and -2 generally as proposed, with several modifications for clarity and consistency with the revisions to \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) discussed above.",
                        "Final comment 19(c)-1 explains the differences between final \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) and other provisions in \u00a7\u20091005.19, as well as other requirements elsewhere in of Regulation E, and clarifies that, for agreements that are not offered to the general public, the issuer is not required to post and maintain the agreements on its publicly available Web site, but is still required to provide each individual consumer with access to his or her specific prepaid account agreement under \u00a7\u20091005.19(d). This comment also clarifies the requirements for issuers that are not required to submit agreements to the Bureau because they qualify for the de minimis exception under \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(4) or the agreements qualify for the product testing exception under \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(5). In addition, this final comment does not contain the proposed explanation that an issuer that is not required to submit agreements to the Bureau may be required to post the long form disclosure required by proposed \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ii) online, depending on the methods by which the issuer offers prepaid accounts to consumers, as the Bureau does not believe it is necessary to include this clarification in commentary.",
                        "Final comment 19(c)-2 explains that, if an issuer offers an agreement to the general public as defined by \u00a7\u20091005.19(a)(6), that issuer must post that agreement on a publicly available Web site it maintains. If an issuer provides consumers with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as balance information or copies of statements, through a third-party Web site, the issuer is considered to maintain that Web site for purposes of \u00a7\u20091005.19.

For example, if two financial institutions are involved in issuing a prepaid program, one may have fewer than 3,000 open accounts while the other has more than 3,000 open accounts. It may be difficult to determine whether, for example, the de minimis exception in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(4) applies in such cases.

The Bureau therefore believed it would be beneficial to clarify which institution would be the prepaid account issuer for purposes of proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19.

The Bureau has also changed the name of final comment 19(a)(4)-3 from Partner Institution Web sites as proposed to Third-Party Web sites because the content of the comment is primarily related to third-party Web sites; a partner institution Web site is merely an example of a third-party Web site that may be deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of final \u00a7\u20091005.19.",

This comment also explains that each issuer may use the program manager to submit the agreement on its behalf, in accordance with final comment 19(a)(4)-2. Because the number and the role of the entities involved in a particular prepaid account agreement may vary, the Bureau believes it is clearer to require issuers, not program managers (or other parties), to submit these agreements to the Bureau. In addition, the Bureau believes that submitting a separate agreement for each issuer, rather than submitting one agreement with multiple issuers listed, as suggested by one commenter, will be less confusing to consumers and other parties reviewing agreements on the Bureau's Web site in the future."

These commenters urged the Bureau to exclude prepaid account agreements that are not offered to the public (such as for payroll card, government benefit, and campus card accounts) from the requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(b) to submit agreements to the Bureau for posting on the Bureau's publicly available Web site and the requirement in proposed \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) to post agreements on the issuer's publicly available Web site. These commenters explained that for these types of accounts, an issuer could have thousands of agreements that have been negotiated between the issuer and a third party (such as an employer, a government agency, or a university) and that are often tailored to fit the needs of individual programs. These commenters stated that such volume and variety would clutter the Bureau's and issuer's Web sites, overwhelm consumers, and cause confusion because consumers might not understand which agreement applies to their account or why the terms differ. These commenters stated that even if consumers could navigate the volume of agreements, the third party\u2014not the consumers\u2014chooses these agreements, so comparison shopping would not be an option. In addition, these commenters stated that the public posting of these agreements raises confidentiality concerns regarding the disclosure of proprietary account features, which would compromise the issuer's ability to negotiate customized account agreements. The commenters also argued that a public posting requirement would undermine competition because it would inhibit the incentive for companies to develop novel products.",

These commenters argued that publicly posting these agreements would encourage competition and transparency, which they stated would help lower fees, and facilitate comparison shopping, which they stated would result in more informed consumer decisions. One consumer group argued that the public posting of agreements would assist the Bureau, researchers, and consumer advocates in compiling information to issue reports and shed light on inappropriate practices by market participants. This commenter explained that the payroll card market, in particular, is secretive and issuers and employers in this market do not generally provide fee schedules when asked. This commenter added that when it began issuing reports on unemployment compensation cards, fees started to come down. This commenter also argued that employers, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and other entities considering a prepaid card program would be able to see and compare the various terms offered in the market. This commenter further argued that, while payroll card issuers may have confidentiality clauses in their contracts with employers, those clauses do not bind employees because once a card is issued to an employee, the agreement is no longer confidential. Finally, the office of a State Attorney General argued that even though consumers who enroll in payroll card programs are not typically able to comparison shop because the employer selects their program, they would still be able to compare their plan with other wage payment options, such as a checking account, direct deposit, and other prepaid accounts.",

                "The Bureau believes that the submission of all prepaid account agreements, including payroll card, government benefit, campus card, and other account agreements that are not available to the general public, is essential for the Bureau's market monitoring efforts. Furthermore, the Bureau's posting of these agreements to its Web site in the future will increase transparency in the terms of these agreements and the types and amounts of the fees imposed in these programs. The increased transparency will allow the public, including consumers, to become better informed about these accounts, which will likely encourage competition and improve fees in the various markets. In addition, the public posting to the Bureau's Web site in the future will allow entities such as employers, government agencies, and universities considering making prepaid account programs available to their constituencies to review similar agreements with other institutions and compare the various terms before entering into their own agreements. The Bureau also agrees that consumers of accounts with agreements that are not available to the general public, such as payroll card accounts, will be able to make meaningful comparisons with other wage payment options, such as a checking account, direct deposit, and other prepaid accounts. For these reasons, the Bureau declines to exclude payroll card, government benefit, campus card, and other account agreements that are not available to the general public from the final rule's submission requirement, as requested by some commenters.",
                "The Bureau is persuaded, however, that posting agreements that are not offered to the general public to the issuer's publicly available Web site may impose unnecessary administrative burden and have little consumer benefit. The Bureau has thus modified \u00a7\u20091005.19(c), discussed below, to exempt agreements that are not offered to the general public from the posting requirement. The final rule does not require issuers to post on the issuer's publicly available Web site agreements that are not offered to the general public, such as payroll card, government benefit, and campus card agreements. However, issuers of these agreements are still required to provide consumers with access to their specific agreements, as required by final \u00a7\u20091005.19(d). See the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.19(c) below for additional information regarding the posting requirement."

                "The Bureau is finalizing \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) because it continues to believe, as explained in the proposal, that it is crucial to inform consumers that there may be a cost for features not otherwise captured in the short form disclosure. Disclosure of this information will help both alert consumers that the short form is not a comprehensive fee disclosure and encourage consumers to seek out more information about the prepaid account from the long form disclosure and other sources. As noted in the proposal, the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing revealed that participants often did not know all the fees that might be assessed prior to their purchase of a prepaid account. In addition, the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing revealed that, while not all participants understood the significance of the disclosure of the number of additional fee types, participants were keenly interested in this disclosure, which the Bureau believes will motivate consumers to seek more information about these additional fee types.\n            \n          ",
                "The Bureau declines to use a more general statement to alert consumers that there may be additional fees, as requested by some industry commenters. The Bureau believes that disclosure of the specific number of additional fee types, as opposed to a general statement regarding other fees charged, provides consumers with concrete information and stronger motivation to both better inform themselves and to direct their searches for additional information. Moreover, as discussed below, the Bureau believes that focusing the disclosure on tallying the types of fees rather than counting each variation in fees toward the total directly addresses industry's concerns that disclosing a specific number of other fees would prompt consumers to assign undue negative weight to the fact that a product may have many fee variations. The change to fee types also helps reduce compliance burden across the two related disclosures of the number of additional fee types required by this provision and the disclosure of additional fee types required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix).",
                "The Bureau disagrees with commenters that the comprehensive disclosure of all fees in another disclosure, such as the long form or the cardholder agreement, negates the rationale for disclosing the number of additional fee types in the short form. The Bureau believes that consumers generally would rely solely on the short form disclosure in making their acquisition decisions if they do not see language that specifically emphasizes the value of consulting the long form. The Bureau thus believes that listing the total number of fee types that are not otherwise listed on the short form will complement and enhance the statement in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii) directing consumers to the long form, providing a concrete incentive to consult the longer disclosure for products that are more complex.\n\n             Specifically, the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing revealed that, when asked how they could learn more about \u201cother fees\u201d not shown on the short form, practically all participants referred to the financial institution's telephone number and Web site disclosed on the prototype short form disclosure (i.e., the information sources required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(xiii)).\n             In sum, the Bureau believes that the disclosure of the number of additional fee types in the short form pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) will directly inform consumers of important information and serve to spur them to further inquiry in other more detailed disclosures.",
                "The Bureau acknowledges commenters' concerns that some consumers may tend to assume that a prepaid account with a relatively high number of additional fees is more expensive or less desirable than other accounts, even when the opposite may be true. In part to address this concern, the Bureau is finalizing the rule requiring financial institutions to disclose the total number of fee types, rather than the total number of all fees (including all fee variations within a fee type) that would have been required under the proposal. Requiring disclosure of the number of fee types instead of the number of discrete fees likely will reduce the number required to be disclosed for a typical prepaid account program. The Bureau believes that this modification for the final rule should help ameliorate the risk raised by some commenters that consumers will reject prepaid accounts with a high number of additional fees out of hand without seeking more detailed fee information to determine whether the products meet their needs. Moreover, the requirements for both final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix) are based on fee types (as opposed to one being based on discrete fees and the other on fee types), thereby reducing the burden of developing and maintaining two separate counts to determine and disclose the elements under their respective rules. The Bureau is also providing a list of fee types and fee variations in final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2, discussed below\u2014which are based on fees that the Bureau is aware exist in the current prepaid marketplace\u2014that a financial institution may use when determining both the number of additional fee types charged pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and any additional fee types to disclose pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix). The Bureau believes that these provisions will reduce the risks and burdens raised by commenters concerning the proposed disclosure of the total number of fees not otherwise listed, while still providing the consumer with an important signal and incentive to investigate prepaid accounts that have more complex pricing structures.",
                "In addition, the Bureau believes that this modification addresses commenters' concerns, at least in part, regarding a potential chill to innovation of new features because such fee variations within a fee type will not be required to be separately counted for purposes of this disclosure. The Bureau intends to monitor compliance with this rule, including financial institutions' disclosures of the number of additional fee types charged, as well as market innovations in the prepaid industry more generally, and will consider additional action in future rulemakings if necessary.",
                "Modifying the final rule to require disclosure of the number of fee types also addresses concerns raised by some commenters that the proposed disclosure would have included many fees that are not commonly incurred by consumers\u2014including fees for discretionary features that require specific consumer action before they are incurred. For example, under the final rule, a financial institution would count bill payment as an additional fee type if it offered this feature, but, unlike the rule as proposed, would not count each of the discrete fee variations within bill payment such as ACH bill payment, paper check bill payment, check cancellation, and regular or expedited delivery of a paper check. Thus, in addition to a reduction in the overall number of additional fees required to be disclosed under the final rule, a financial institution would similarly not be required to disclose many of the less common fees and fees triggered by affirmative consumer action. While some of the additional fee types required to be disclosed in the final rule may still be less common or triggered only when a consumer elects to use an optional service, the Bureau reiterates that the primary objective of this provision is to alert consumers to fee information absent from the short form and to spur consumers to take action to gain a more fulsome understanding of the terms of a prospective prepaid account; this disclosure fulfils this objective.",
                "As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) below, the Bureau is adopting a de minimis threshold with respect to the disclosure of specific additional fee types. The Bureau does not believe a de minimis threshold would be appropriate for the disclosure required by \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) regarding the total number of additional fee types. The Bureau notes, however, that with the de minimis threshold in \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix), disclosure of such fee types under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) would not be required, although such fee types would be counted in the total number of additional fee types disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii).",
                "Finally, the Bureau continues to believe it is not necessary to include in the final rule specific requirements for updating the statement regarding the number of additional fee types charged required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A). As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of \u00a7\u20091005.18(b) above, the Bureau does not believe that financial institutions change the fee schedules for prepaid accounts often, particularly those sold at retail. If a financial institution is making available a new optional service for all prepaid accounts in a particular prepaid account program, Regulation E provides a means for financial institutions to notify consumers of terms associated with a new EFT service that is added to a consumer's account, in \u00a7\u20091005.7(c). A financial institution may provide new consumer disclosures in accordance with \u00a7\u20091005.7(c) post-acquisition, without needing to pull and replace card packaging that does not reflect that new optional feature in the disclosure of the number of additional fee types pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A). The Bureau does expect, however, that financial institutions will keep their other disclosures up to date (including those provided electronically and orally, as well as disclosures provided in writing that are not a part of pre-printed packaging materials, such as those printed by a financial institution upon a consumer's request). The Bureau intends to monitor financial institutions' practices in this area, however, and may consider additional requirements in a future rulemaking if necessary.",
                "Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-1 clarifies what fee types to count in the total number of additional fee types, specifically excluding fees otherwise required to be disclosed in and outside the short form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (5) and any finance charges as described in final Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11) imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in final \u00a7\u20091026.61. Excluding the static fees and fees required to be disclosed outside the short form avoids the duplicative counting of fees already disclosed to the consumer. As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau has made a strategic decision to focus the bulk of the short form disclosure on usage of the prepaid account itself rather than any charges related to overdraft credit features. The possibility that consumers may be offered an overdraft credit feature for use in connection with the prepaid account is addressed in the short form pursuant to \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(x), which requires the following statement if such a feature may be offered: \u201cYou may be offered overdraft/credit after [x] days. Fees would apply.\u201d Consistent with this overall decision, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to exclude any finance charges related to an overdraft credit feature that may be offered at a later date to some prepaid consumers from the disclosures regarding additional fees under both final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix). If consumers are interested in such a feature, they can look to the Regulation Z disclosures in the long form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(4)(vii), discussed below, for more details.",
                "Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-1.i explains that the number of additional fee types includes only fee types under which the financial institution may charge fees; accordingly, third-party fees are not included unless they are imposed for services performed on behalf of the financial institution. The comment additionally clarifies that the number of additional fee types includes only fee types the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account; accordingly, additional fee types does not include other revenue sources such as interchange fees or fees paid by employers for payroll card programs, government agencies for government benefit programs, or other entities sponsoring prepaid account programs for financial disbursements.",
                "Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-1.ii explains that fee types that bear a relationship to, but are separate from, the static fees disclosed in the short form must be counted as additional fee types for purposes of final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii). The comment also provides a detailed explanation regarding the treatment of international ATM fees and fees for reloading funds into a prepaid account in a form other than cash (such as electronic reload and check reload). In addition, the comment explains that additional fee types disclosed in the short form pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) must be counted in the total number of additional fee types. This is because the exclusions in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(1) and (2) are only for fees required to be disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (5) and any finance charges imposed on the prepaid account as described in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.4(b)(11)(ii) in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z \u00a7\u20091026.61. Further, the statement required by final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(B) explains that the additional fee types disclosed are some of the total number of additional fee types.",
                "The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 to provide guidance regarding the calculation of the number of additional fee types pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) as well as to address concerns raised by an industry commenter regarding how to categorize fees in determining the additional fee types to disclose under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix). The comment explains that the term fee type, as used in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix), is a general category under which a financial institution charges fees to consumers. A financial institution may charge only one fee within a particular fee type, or may charge two or more variations of fees within the same fee type. (The Bureau notes that an additional fee type for which a financial institution does not charge any fee to the consumer, including for any variations of the additional fee type, is not counted in the total number of additional fee types under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) nor required to be disclosed on the short form under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix).) The comment goes on to provide a list of examples of fee types a financial institution may use when determining both the number of additional fee types charged pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and any additional fee types to disclose pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix). The comment also explains that a financial institution may create an appropriate name for other additional fee types.",
                "The Bureau compiled the list of examples of fee types in new comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 to provide guidance to financial institutions and to help facilitate their categorization of additional fee types for satisfying the requirements in final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (ix). The list also may encourage standardization of this portion of the short form in that, although additional fee types disclosed will vary across short forms for different prepaid account programs, the Bureau believes financial institutions will generally use consistent nomenclature for additional fee types identified on the list. The Bureau compiled this list of examples of fee types based on particular fee types referenced in comments received on the proposal and by reviewing the packaging of and disclosures for scores of prepaid account programs.\n             The Bureau balanced multiple considerations in compiling the list in final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 for purposes of both final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix), including existing industry practices with regard to fee types, the accounting burdens associated with relatively narrower or broader definitions of fee types, and the potential benefits to both industry and consumers in using narrower definitions of fee types to communicate information about specific account features and fees. The Bureau believes the resulting list strikes an appropriate balance by capturing categories and terms employed by the prepaid industry itself that will be useful to financial institutions and consumers in determining and understanding additional fee types. The Bureau is providing flexibility to financial institutions to fashion appropriate names for other fee types, including fee types for services that do not yet exist in the prepaid marketplace.",
                "Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-3 clarifies that, pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(vi), a financial institution using the multiple service plan short form disclosure pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2) must disclose only the fee for calling customer service via a live agent. Thus, pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii), any charge for calling customer service via an interactive voice response system must be counted in the total number of additional fee types.",
                "Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-4 clarifies that a financial institution must use the same categorization of fee types in the number of additional fee types disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii) and in its determination of which additional fee types to disclose pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix). The Bureau is including this comment on consistency to make clear that a financial institution is not permitted to, for example, shorten its list of fee types into a few broad categories (in order to minimize the number of additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)) but use a more detailed list of fee types broken out into a greater number of categories when assessing its obligations under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) (in order to maximize the number of fee types that may fall below the de minimis threshold pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(2))."

The change in that fee will become effective on August 1. If the issuer submits the agreement to the Bureau on July 31 (for example, because the agreement has been otherwise amended), the agreement submitted should not include the new lower out-of-network ATM withdrawal fee because that lower fee was not in effect on June 30, the last business day of the preceding calendar quarter.

The Bureau notes that final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(6)(i) is not intended to provide an exhaustive list of the ancillary State and Federal law disclosures that are not deemed to be part of an agreement under final \u00a7\u20091005.19.

The Bureau notes that an issuer would not be prohibited by this or any other provision of \u00a7\u20091005.19 from choosing to include these items in submitted agreements.",
                "The Bureau received comments from several consumer groups and one credit union trade association regarding the Bureau's request for comment about whether issuers should be required to post agreements on their Web sites in an electronic format that is readily usable by the general public, or whether issuers should be required to provide agreements using, for example, a machine-readable text format, such as JSON or XML, that could be used by the Bureau or third parties to more easily create comparison shopping tools.\n             The consumer groups argued that agreements should be submitted in a machine-readable text format because this format would allow researchers and other third parties to analyze information more easily and create comparison shopping tools. The credit union trade association disagreed, however, arguing that requiring agreements to be submitted in a format other than PDF would impose substantial software engineering fees on issuers. The Bureau appreciates the comments it received and continues to believe that it is important for issuers to submit agreements in a machine-readable format for these agreements to be useful to both the Bureau in its market monitoring efforts and to the consumers and other parties reviewing agreements on the Bureau's Web site in the future. The Bureau will provide technical specifications that will include details regarding appropriate file formats that the Bureau expects issuers will use when submitting new agreements and amended agreements following a substantive change.",

One of these commenters explained that many issuers use marketing or other affinity related names that make it difficult for a consumer to know which entity issued the prepaid account. The Bureau has considered these comments will consider incorporating such search functionality into its Web site.",
                "The Bureau is finalizing comment 19(b)(6)-1 substantially as proposed, with several modifications for clarity and consistency with the revisions to \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(1). In addition, the Bureau has removed from final comment 19(b)(6)-1 the reference to \u201coffers to the public\u201d and leaving only the term \u201coffers\u201d to reflect the changes to \u00a7\u20091005.19(a)(5) as discussed. Specifically, final comment 19(b)(6)-1 explains that agreements submitted to the Bureau must contain the provisions of the agreement and fee information currently in effect. For example, on June 1, an issuer decides to decrease the out-of-network ATM withdrawal fee associated with one of the agreements it offers. The change in that fee will become effective on August 1. The issuer must submit and post the amended agreement with the decreased out-of-network ATM withdrawal fee to the Bureau by August 31 as required by final \u00a7\u20091005.19(b)(2) and (c)."

The Bureau believes that a brief transition statement linking these two disclosures will enhance consumer understanding of both disclosures and dispel potential consumer misunderstanding that features are not offered if they are not disclosed on the short form.\n             Thus, the line in the short form disclosure following the static fees would disclose the following or substantially similar clauses: \u201cWe charge X other types of fees.

The Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing of such explanations support this conclusion.\n             Pre-proposal testing of a statement intended to inform consumers that the fees listed were those that generated significant revenue for the financial institution resulted in minimal participant comprehension or notice.\n\n             Post-proposal testing of a similar disclosure that, in addition to including an explanation of the criteria for disclosing such fees (i.e., that the two fees listed were the most commonly charged), also directed consumers where to find detail about all fees, similarly did not increase participant comprehension.\n            \n          ",
                "Thus, to make the connection for consumers that the additional fee types disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) are a subset of the number of additional fee types disclosed pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A), and that absence of any feature on the short form does not necessarily mean the prepaid account program does not offer that feature, the Bureau is including in the final rule the transition statement set forth above.",

The comment explains that a financial institution that makes no disclosure pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix) may not include a disclosure pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(B). The comment also provides examples regarding substantially similar clauses a financial institution may use in certain circumstances to make its disclosures under final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (B), such as when a financial institution has several additional fee types but is only required to disclose one of them pursuant to final \u00a7\u20091005.18(b)(2)(ix)."
